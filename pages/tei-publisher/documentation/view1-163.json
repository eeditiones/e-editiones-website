One could edit the local register manually in such cases, but from \n      TEI Publisher version 9 we now offer facilities to edit or create an entry in \n      the local register (see arrows marked 2 and 3 in the screenshot) through a form-based interface. Just click on the \n      <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">pencil</span> icon to edit the entry locally (or use <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">plus sign</span> icon to add a completely new one.</p><figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n          <span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <img src=\"register-edit.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 800px; \">\n          </span>\n        </span><figcaption>Accessing register linking and editing functions in annotation editor</figcaption></figure></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
