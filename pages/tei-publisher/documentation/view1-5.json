This API is\n          used in TEI Publisher by client-side UI components but can be equally well utilized by\n          independent software which harnesses functionality exposed via the API without being\n          forced to rely on Publisher's client-side components. </p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\"> On the server a new package, <span class=\"tei-filename code\">oas-router</span>, reads the API\n          specification and uses it to map HTTP requests to XQuery functions which perform actual\n          API operations. Other packages, particularly UI web components (\n            <span class=\"tei-filename code\">pb-components</span>) and TEI Processing Model library (\n            <span class=\"tei-filename code\">tei-publisher-lib</span>) underwent necessary changes to communicate with\n          the new API as well as retain full backwards compatibility. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">Beyond the structural changes a number of reported issues has been fixed and broader\n          test coverage for all packages introduced. A sophisticated CI setup based on Docker has\n          been created. Extensive test suite has been prepared for individual components.\n          Furthermore, every API operation is independently tested against the specification, to\n          assure that e.g. parameter and response types correspond exactly to the definition.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"tei-para\"> Thanks to community contributions via <a href=\"https://crwd.in/tei-publisher\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Crowdin</a>, TEI Publisher is now\n          available in 20 languages. </p>\n\n        <p class=\"tei-para\"> See chapter on <a href=\"/?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=updating\" class=\"tei-link3\" target=\"\">Updating</a> for information how to update\n          your app to take advantage of these developments. </p>\n      </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
