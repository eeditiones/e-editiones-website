With Publisher web component releases published on npm,\n              updating the user interface for all Publisher-based apps is just a question of\n              changing a single variable in the configuration file.</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Furthermore, Publisher's library of web components - true to the basic idea of\n              <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Web\n                Components Standard</a>\n              can be included in any HTML webpage e.g. can be embedded\n              into existing CMS or any other publishing solution, even if it's not running\n              eXist-db.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Similarly, if you prefer to write your own application using any of the popular\n              frameworks like\n              <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">angular, vue or react</span>\n              you can easily import the\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-components</span>\n              package from npm and use it directly in your\n              project.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">As a final consequence, this change decouples the component library from the TEI\n              Publisher app. It is now possible to host multiple applications, which depend on\n              different versions of the component library, without conflict within the same eXist-db\n              instance, a point of importance for institutions with numerous projects.</p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">Redesigned and simplified CSS styling customization</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Encapsulation of styles offered by web components can be a mixed blessing and\n              poses some challenges when customizing the aesthetics of components to fit a project.\n              While some aspects of component styling remained unaccessible for customization in\n              previous versions, Publisher 6 exposes majority of styling properties via standard CSS\n              files and theme variables. Stylesheets can also be specified within the ODD, as\n              previously, or through\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-view</span>\n              component configuration attributes.\n            </p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">Extended internationalization</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">I18n support has been extended to cover not only the labels in HTML templates but\n              also within web components. A mechanism for project specific language files extending\n              the default Publisher label collection has been added.</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Thanks to community contributions via\n              <a href=\"https://crwd.in/tei-publisher\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Crowdin</a>\n              a number of new languages\n              has been added and existing ones updated.\n            </p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">Subcorpora - new TEI Publisher data organization</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Publisher's pre-populated data collection is now split into\n              <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Playground</span>\n              and\n              <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">TEI Publisher demo\n                collection</span>\n              areas which illustrate how this mechanism could be used to\n              host multiple subcorpora within single TEI Publisher application.\n            </p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">New and improved web components</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-select-feature</span>\n              and\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-toggle-feature</span>\n              components have\n              been extended to allow for interactive changing of display parameters (like switching\n              between regularized or original spelling) which can be then processed client or\n              server-side.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">New components have been created to handle MEI music notation as well as for web\n              component API documentation and demo pages.</p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">User interface of the ODD editor has been improved.</p>\n          </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">Experimental incremental scroll mode has been introduced to improve performance\n              for very long documents presented in single page mode.</p>\n          </li></ol>\n      </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
