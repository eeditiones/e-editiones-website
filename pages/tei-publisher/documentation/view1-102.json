If you followed the <pb-link class=\"tei-link3\" uri=\"?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=customization-best-practice\" xml-id=\"customization-best-practice\" emit=\"transcription\">best practice recommendations</pb-link>, you can always update the core of TEI Publisher by replacing the <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules/lib</span> directory with the newer version. However, you may also need to adjust the configuration and code modules outside this directory to match the new release (details concerning a particular version are documented below). This obviously also applies to any custom code you have added or modified yourself. In general we would recommend the following procedure:</p><ol class=\"tei-procedure\"><li class=\"tei-step\"><p class=\"tei-para\">Replace <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules/lib</span></p></li><li class=\"tei-step\"><p class=\"tei-para\">Check <span class=\"tei-filename code\">expath-pkg.xml</span> for changed dependencies</p></li><li class=\"tei-step\">\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">Have a look at the other XQuery files in <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules</span>: new releases\n          may introduce new files here, which should be copied. Also check if any of the other files\n          here were updated, e.g. <span class=\"tei-filename code\">facets.xql</span>, <span class=\"tei-filename code\">nlp-config</span>\n          etc. Make sure to keep your own changes.</p>\n      </li><li class=\"tei-step\"><p class=\"tei-para\">Build your app and try to install it. This may result in errors to fix (e.g. variables/functions missing in <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules/config.xqm</span>.</p></li><li class=\"tei-step\"><p class=\"tei-para\">Once the app starts and is functionally working, you can look into replacing other files, e.g.\n          the global CSS file in <span class=\"tei-filename code\">resources/css/theme.css</span> or the javascript\n          utility files in <span class=\"tei-filename code\">resources/scripts</span>.</p></li></ol><p class=\"tei-para\">For apps created with TEI Publisher 6 updating to 7 or 8 requires only small modifications.\n      Migrating from earlier versions, like 4 or 5, requires more effort, and is described in futher\n      sections.</p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
