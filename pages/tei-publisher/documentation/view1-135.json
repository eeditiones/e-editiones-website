However, they use \n      different ODDs: the annotation view renders the text through a dedicated ODD (annotations.odd) to make sure that all relevant \n      bits of the base text are displayed and there's no hidden information, which would be inaccessible to the editor. The preview HTML panel simply uses\n      the ODD associated with the document (or the base teipublisher.odd otherwise).</p>\n  </pb-observable></div></div>",
