Combined with the\n      client-side reorganization brought by TEI Publisher 6, this will make future updates for\n      generated applications a lot easier. Client-side UI and server-side API are now cleanly\n      separated from any custom app elements.</p><p class=\"tei-para\">For apps created with TEI Publisher 6 updating to 7 requires only small modifications.\n      Migrating from earlier versions, like 4 or 5, requires more effort, and is described in futher\n      sections.</p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
