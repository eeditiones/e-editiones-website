It is rather what kinds of detail a particular project\n        decides to encode or not. Encoding of titles can be a <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">toggle</span> if we just decide to simply say that a text fragment is a title. It could become a\n        <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">semantic</span> annotation if we'd like to associate it with a bibliographical reference or other detailed information.\n      </p>\n    </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
