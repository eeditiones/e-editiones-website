You may then continue with a second round \n        of review by printing out the results again.</p>\n\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">Within our electronic environment, the printout corresponds to the source TEI document and the marks and scribbles are annotations. \n        Until you explicitely merge the annotations into the source TEI, they will be kept separate from the document they apply to. Once merged, \n        a new version of the source TEI document is established and the editing process restarts.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">Notably, TEI Publisher is able to detect existing markup in the base text when it is loaded. Any markup corresponding to a known annotation \n        type will be recognized and displayed as such, therefore it can be modified. In this sense it is slightly different from working with pen and paper.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">From the printout example it should be clear that you cannot change the printed text itself (unless you had some magic paper). Accordingly, \n        annotations are not allowed to change the base text, i.e. the text \"printed\" on the screen. If you want to explicitly indicate a correction, \n        you can use the <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">corr</span> or <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">reg</span> annotation type, which corresponds to the TEI encoding with choice/sic/corr or choice/orig/reg.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">You can use annotations for virtually any kind of inline markup. The only strict requirement is that the <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">base text</span>, our source document,\n        remains stable <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">during an editing session</span> i.e. until annotations are merged. The reason for that is the annotations are anchored to a \n        certain position in the document, so any changes to it would mean that our coordinates might suddenly point to different fragments.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">That said, there's also a special <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">edit</span> annotation type, which does allow you to perform limited editing of a text.\n        It will just \"seamlessly\" change the transcription text fragment \n        without adding any explicit markup. Nevertheless, such a change to the TEI document is only applied when you merge and therefore \n        establish a new base text. The limitation is that only text fragments can be edited: the boundaries of structural markup or annotations may not be crossed.\n        It can be convenient for fixing a typo in a transcription that wasnâ€™t caught when the base text was prepared.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">You also cannot use the annotation editor to modify the structural markup of the base text, i.e. block-level elements like divs, paragraphs, headings or notes. In case you need to change\n        the structure, you have to merge your annotations first, saving a new version of the TEI document and switch to an XML editor to change the XML there. \n        The new document can be then reloaded into the annotation editor and you can continue.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">As already indicated, it is possible to handle common nested encoding structures like <span class=\"tei-tag code\">choice</span> or <span class=\"tei-tag code\">app</span> as annotations. \n        Nevertheless the inner elements, i.e. <span class=\"tei-tag code\">lem</span>, <span class=\"tei-tag code\">rdg</span>, <span class=\"tei-tag code\">sic</span>, <span class=\"tei-tag code\">corr</span> or <span class=\"tei-tag code\">orig</span>, <span class=\"tei-tag code\">reg</span>, need to have \n        simple text content: they cannot be annotated themselves (at least not in the current version).</p>\n    </pb-observable></div></div>",
