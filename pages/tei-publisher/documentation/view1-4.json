There have been small but powerful improvements to facets and numerous minor fixes and extensions, \n              including redesign of the layout templates and ODDs for some of the examples from the Demo Collection.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">This edition has also brought the demise of the <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">teiSimplePrint</span> ODD, previously the source ODD for \n              the <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">teipublisher</span> ODD. Models from the SimplePrint, after thorough review, have been merged into the default TEI Publisher ODD.\n              This is a first step on the road for the extended and rationalized base ODD, a project inspired by the TEI Vanilla meetups \n              of yore and now undertaken by e-editiones in cooperation with the TEI consortium.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">The new annotation editor boasts a new, more user friendly and ergonomic layout with additional \n              capacity to add or edit registry entries from within the editor. Furthermore, a function to find potential matches for \n              the current annotation and review them on the spot is the long awaited feature, which promises to speed up the editing process without \n              compromising quality or consistency.</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">A default set up for local registers of places, people and organizations allows editors to curate these resources under the same \n              roof and at the same time as they annotate the sources. As usual, our registers provide a firm base for extensions and customizations.</p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">\n              Since the release of the previous version there was a new major version of the <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">tei-publisher-lib</span> \n              and numerous releases of TEI Publisher's <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">webcomponents</span> library.\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"tei-para\">See chapter on <pb-link class=\"tei-link3\" uri=\"?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=updating\" xml-id=\"updating\" emit=\"transcription\">Updating</pb-link> for information how to update\n              your app to the newest version.</p>\n          </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
