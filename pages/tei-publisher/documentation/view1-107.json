This makes\n        things more difficult and there are two possible approaches for updating:</p><ul class=\"tei-itemizedlist\"><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\"> generate a new application with TEI Publisher 7 and merge your changes in into the\n            newly generated app. This is the recommended method. If your customizations were limited\n            to e.g. ODD files, CSS styles, templates, index configurations or adding your own code\n            in <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules/</span>, it should all go very smoothly. </p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">update your generated app by modifying the HTML templates you use and copying files\n            from TEI Publisher.</p>\n        </li></ul><p class=\"tei-para\">The first option is strongly recommended and much easier in general. The second option\n        is only for experienced users who have to update apps containing a lot of customized\n        code.</p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
