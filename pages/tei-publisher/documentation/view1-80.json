We\n            nevertheless tried to keep the code as generic as possible, but there are a few settings which may need\n            adjustment.</p>\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">All settings concerning IIIF manifest generation can be found in\n              <span class=\"tei-filename code\">modules/iiif-config.xqm</span>. In particular, you may want to change the following\n            variables/functions:</p>\n          <dl><dt>$iiifc:IMAGE_API_BASE</dt><dd>\n                <p class=\"tei-para\">The base URI of the IIIF image service to use for displaying images</p>\n              </dd><dt>iiifc:milestones</dt><dd>\n                <p class=\"tei-para\">Should return the TEI elements in the document context which reference an image. Usually those are\n                <span class=\"tei-tag code\">pb</span> or <span class=\"tei-tag code\">milestone</span> elements, but other variations are possible.</p>\n              </dd><dt>iiifc:milestone-id</dt><dd>\n                <p class=\"tei-para\">For each element returned by <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">iiifc:milestones</span>, extract the path to the image. By default this\n                  tries to read the image path from the <span class=\"tei--element\">@facs</span> attribute.</p>\n              </dd></dl>\n        </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
