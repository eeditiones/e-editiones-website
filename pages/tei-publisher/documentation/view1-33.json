It has been one of primary concerns in Publisher's design that customization is not\n      only possible on various levels but also encouraged and we aim it to be as simple as\n      possible.</p><p class=\"tei-para\"> Very broadly we can group customization needs into two sets: changing the rules for\n      document transformation (how the source document is translated into the output format) or\n      changing the organization and styling of the rendered web page. In this chapter we'll\n      concentrate on the former, document transformation, which primarily requires modification of\n      the ODD with the <pb-link class=\"tei-link3\" uri=\"?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=pm-syntax\" xml-id=\"pm-syntax\" emit=\"transcription\">TEI Processing Model</pb-link>. The latter would\n      require <pb-link class=\"tei-link3\" uri=\"?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=customizing-page-template\" xml-id=\"customizing-page-template\" emit=\"transcription\">adjustments of the page template</pb-link>. In\n      both cases, it may be best to choose as your starting point an already existing ODD or page\n      template and adjust it. </p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
