If you made changes in the form, you need to save first to update the ODD. The\n            ODD XML will be opened in a new tab, showing eXist's browser-based editor,\n          <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">eXide</span>\n          .\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">\n          While using\n          <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">eXide</span>\n          is sufficient for small edits, we\n            really recommend using specialized XML editor like\n          <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">oXygen</span>\n          for serious work on your TEI files. It will help you with many\n            tasks, starting with the syntax and documentation. You can edit ODDs stored in eXist\n            using Oxygen's\n          <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">webdav</span>\n          support or the\n          <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">eXist data\n              source</span>\n          function.\n        </p>\n        <div class=\"tei-note3 note\"><h4 class=\"tei-title4\">Important</h4><p class=\"tei-para\">\n            If you edit the ODD XML by hand, there are some caveats you need to be aware of:\n              the visual editor will automatically check if there are existing\n            <span class=\"tei-tag code\">elementSpec</span>\n            s for a new element in any of the ODDs your ODD inherits from.\n              When editing by hand, you need to do this yourself. It's best to always have the base\n              ODDs:\n            <span class=\"tei-link2\"><pb-edit-xml path=\"/db/apps/tei-publisher/odd/tei_simplePrint.odd\">\n              <span class=\"tei-filename code\">tei_simplePrint.odd</span>\n            <iron-icon icon=\"icons:open-in-new\"></iron-icon></pb-edit-xml></span>\n            and\n            <span class=\"tei-link2\"><pb-edit-xml path=\"/db/apps/tei-publisher/odd/teipublisher.odd\">\n              <span class=\"tei-filename code\">teipublisher.odd</span>\n            <iron-icon icon=\"icons:open-in-new\"></iron-icon></pb-edit-xml></span>\n            open on the side.
