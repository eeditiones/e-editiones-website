The ODD XML\n          will be opened in a new tab, showing eXist's browser-based editor, <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">\n            eXide</span>. </p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\"> While using <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">eXide</span> is sufficient for small edits, we\n          really recommend using specialized XML editor like <span class=\"tei-emphasis1\">oXygen</span>\n          for serious work on your TEI files. It will help you with many tasks, starting with the\n          syntax and documentation. You can edit ODDs stored in eXist using Oxygen's <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">\n            webdav</span> support or the <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">eXist data source</span> function. </p>\n        <div class=\"tei-note3 note\"><h4 class=\"tei-title4\">Important</h4><p class=\"tei-para\"> If you edit the ODD XML by hand, there are some caveats you need to be aware of:\n            the visual editor will automatically check if there are existing <span class=\"tei-tag code\">elementSpec</span>\n            s for a new element in any of the ODDs your ODD inherits from. When editing by hand, you\n            need to do this yourself. It's best to always have the base <span class=\"tei-link2\"><pb-edit-xml path=\"/db/apps/tei-publisher/odd/teipublisher.odd\">\n              <span class=\"tei-filename code\">teipublisher.odd</span>\n            <iron-icon icon=\"icons:open-in-new\"></iron-icon></pb-edit-xml></span> open on the side. It is located in the same collection as your odd, i.e.\n              <span class=\"tei-filename code\">/db/apps/tei-publisher/odd</span>. </p><p class=\"tei-para\"> For example, to modify the element spec for <span class=\"tei-tag code\">dateline</span>, check <span class=\"tei-filename code\">\n              teipublisher.odd</span>, where you'll find a definition already. Copy it over to\n            your ODD and start modifying it. </p><p class=\"tei-para\"> Pay attention to the <span class=\"tei--element\">@mode</span> attribute on <span class=\"tei-tag code\">elementSpec</span>.\n            You must set this to <span class=\"tei-parameter code\">change</span> if you are overwriting an elementSpec\n            which already exists in the inherited ODDs. If not, set it to\n            <span class=\"tei-parameter code\">add</span>. </p></div>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\"> To test any changes, switch back to the tab in which you viewed your document (e.g.\n          Graves' letter) and select <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">Admin</span> / <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">Recompile\n            ODD</span> from the menu. </p>\n      </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
