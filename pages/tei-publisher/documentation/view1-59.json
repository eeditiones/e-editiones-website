It comes handy\n            if you need to process the same XML more than once for different purposes. One common\n            example would be to render a person reference once in the running text and again, as a\n            footnote, but then perhaps together with the associated commentary but without\n            information about textual features related to the process of writing, like scribal\n            errrors in the spelling or gaps and stains on the parchment. As a rule of thumb, setting\n            a mode is helpful where it would not be possible to distinguish the scenario to apply\n            neither by the context in which the element appears in the XML source nor by the\n            external parameter passed into the ODD. </p>\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">tei-publisher-lib 3 allows you to specify this new extension attribute,\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">@pb:mode</span>, on a <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">model</span>. The value of the attribute will be\n            taken as the name of the mode, and subsequently called models can check it (e.g. in a\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">model</span>\n            <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">predicate</span>) via this special variable, e.g.\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">$mode=\"register\"</span> if your model definition specified this value, e.g.\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">&lt;model behaviour=\"block\" pb:mode=\"register\"&gt;</span>. </p>\n        </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
