Just the name of the element changes to\n              <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">&lt;pb:set-param&gt;</span>, marking this as a special parameter which is\n            \"inherited\" by subsequent models. </p>\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">Common motivation to use this feature would be for efficiency, to compute certain\n            value once and just use it many times afterwards. Let's imagine that every paragraph\n            exposes a citation button which always starts with the author, title and other\n            information from the publication statement part of the TEI file and only ends with a\n            paragraph number. We could easily prepare the initial sequence on a division level and\n            have it available to all nested paragraphs, thus saving the processing time required to\n            look up from the paragraph to the TEI header every time. </p>\n        </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
