Most\n          editions will try to link those to a description of the entity, either provided by an\n          external authority file or from a local resource. In any case you will want to reference a\n          unique identifier to mark occurrences of the same entity throughout the edition.</p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">When choosing a semantic annotation from the toolbar, you will therefore see an additional panel, which allows you to consult the authority file\n          configured for the annotation type, e.g. Geonames for places or GND for people:</p>\n        <figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <span class=\"tei--element\">\n              <img src=\"ann-person.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 800px; \">\n            </span>\n          </span><figcaption>Annotating a person</figcaption></figure>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">The semantic annotation dialog displays the query results for you to choose from and the query sent initially corresponds to the text selection\n          made. Often this may not find the relevant entity, but you can change the query in the input field on top of the dialog and run the search again by\n          pressing enter.</p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">Use the icon to the left of an entry name to select it. The reference ID of the entry will be copied into the top input field in the details panel\n          and a short summary of the entity should appear beneath:</p>\n        <figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <span class=\"tei--element\">\n              <img src=\"ann-entity-selected.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 800px; \">\n            </span>\n          </span><figcaption>Right panel after selecting an entry</figcaption></figure>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">The ID will be used as reference in the resulting TEI, i.e. it will appear in an attribute attached to e.g. <span class=\"tei-tag code\">persName</span> or other TEI\n          element. The exact mapping between an annotation type and a TEI snippet produced can be freely configured (see below).</p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">Semantic annotations are stored in the annotation list immediately after you select an\n          authority entry, so you don't have to click anywhere else to confirm your choice.</p>\n          <p class=\"tei-para\"><span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">NB:</span> at times you will find that an entity doesn't yet exist in the external authority register. \n            In TEI Publisher you can now also add entries to your local register.
