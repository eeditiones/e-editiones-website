We strongly suggest following the recommendations outlined in the <a href=\"https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/production_good_practice\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Production Use - Good Practice</a> of the eXist-db documentation. One important point is\n      to always run eXist-db in production behind a proxy server, which serves as an intermediary to\n      control and protect access to a server on which the database runs. More information about\n      proxy servers and eXist-db can be found in the article <a href=\"https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/production_web_proxying\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Proxying eXist-db\n        behind a Web Server</a>.</p><p class=\"tei-para\">One common function of a proxy server is \"hiding\" or translating requests to the\n      collection where TEI Publisher applications actually live to a shorter and more memorable\n      domain name. As a consequence, the internal application links must be correctly set, depending\n      on the context in which the app operates. TEI Publisher based apps allow developers to control\n      this behaviour via a special variable in <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">modules/config.xqm</span> called\n        <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">$config:context-path</span>. </p><p class=\"tei-para\">The variable <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">$config:context-path</span> by default determines the context path\n      depending on the presence of the <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">teipublisher.context-path</span> system variable or the\n        <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">X-Forwarded-Host</span> HTTP header. If the proxy server sets the\n        <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">X-Forwarded-Host</span> HTTP header, TEI Publisher app will recognize it is running\n      behind a proxy and adjust the context path on its own.</p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
