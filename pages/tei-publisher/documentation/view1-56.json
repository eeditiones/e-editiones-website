The TEI Publisher library thus extends the processing model syntax with\n          two custom elements for defining code templates.</p><p class=\"tei-para\">While TEI Publisher does provide ways to write your own behaviours in XQuery and thus\n          extend the ones defined in the guidelines, this should only be used as last resort: custom\n          XQuery behaviours limit the portability of the ODD and are bad for maintenance.</p><p class=\"tei-para\"> Avoiding custom behaviours works quite well for HTML output and we have realized\n          complex projects with just two or three extension behaviours. Things start to become more\n          difficult if you try to output LaTeX though: there are hundreds of packages to use, and\n          users typically define their own macros or environments for all recurring typesetting\n          tasks. For example, to print a TEI <span class=\"tei-tag code\">persName</span> , experienced LaTeX users would\n          normally create a corresponding <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">\\persName</span> macro and handle the formatting\n          details there. Unfortunately, out of the box the TEI processing model does not facilitate\n          this level of customization. </p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
