You\n              can run\n            <span class=\"tei-command code\">java -version</span>\n            on a command line to check which version of\n              Java you have. Make sure you have at least Java 8 (recommended: Java 11). Please note\n              that the\n            <span class=\"tei-command code\">java -version</span>\n            shows the full version string, so 1.8.0 or\n              similar instead of just 8.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">\n            If you do not have Java installed, you can choose between a variety of different\n              Java distributions for your operating system. While these are largely equivalent, so\n              far we have had the smoothest installation experience across operating systems with\n              the\n            <a href=\"https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Zulu\n                Community OpenJDK</a>\n            builds. In particular for Windows users, this provides the\n              best out of the box experience.\n          </p>\n        </pb-observable></div></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
