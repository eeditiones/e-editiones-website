It also provides a preview of how\n        the text would be displayed via one of the available ODDs. You can choose between one of four tabs, each dedicated to a specific aspect or format:</p>\n        <ol class=\"tei-orderedlist\"><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">the resulting HTML, i.e. how your document would display in TEI Publisher if the annotations were merged, rendered through the ODD selected by\n            the dropdown to the right</p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">the TEI of the entire document if annotations were merged</p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">the internal JSON structure representing the annotations (for debugging purposes)</p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">the TEI fragments which would be changed if annotations were merged</p>\n        </li></ol>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">What you see in the preview does not mean that the TEI source document has been already changed: it just applies the\n        annotations in memory, leaving the source untouched. It allows you to double check if\n        annotations will be applied in the correct way. When you are satisfied with the review, the merge button described in \n        the <pb-link class=\"tei-link3\" uri=\"?odd=docbook.odd&amp;view=div&amp;id=annotations-merge\" xml-id=\"annotations-merge\" emit=\"transcription\">previous section</pb-link>, will trigger the permanent change.\n      </p>\n      <figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n          <span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <img src=\"ann-preview.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\" style=\"width: 800px; \">\n          </span>\n        </span><figcaption>HTML preview</figcaption></figure>\n    </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
