The commands shown below were used on a Linux system for <a href=\"https://github.com/eeditiones/dodis-wall/commit/491267575a97c101361e10de4001db2f97cc3d29\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">updating the Dodis demo app</a>, but with appropriate adjustments to the syntax the\n        same actions could be performed on a different operating system. Alternatively the migration\n        can be executed using eXide's file manager. </p><p class=\"tei-para\">If you decide to work with the command line, as suggested here, clone TEI Publisher 7\n        into the directory one level above the one containing your own application source\n        code:</p><pb-code-highlight class=\"tei-programlisting5\" language=\"shell\">git clone https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-app.git\ncd tei-publisher-app\ngit checkout v7.0.0</pb-code-highlight><p class=\"tei-para\">At this point we need to move to the directory where your own application source code is\n        stored:</p><pb-code-highlight class=\"tei-programlisting5\" language=\"shell\">cd ../my-custom-app</pb-code-highlight></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
