This is a natural consequence of TEI's versatility and broad scope of\n        its application. What follows, requirements for the document view - both its layout and\n        composition as well as processing rules governing the transformation of the text of the\n        document itself - will differ to a great extent. Sample documents which are included in TEI\n        Publisher's installation package do not exhaust its applications but rather aim to present\n        some chosen use cases:</p>\n      <ul class=\"tei-itemizedlist\"><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">\n            <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Critik der reinen Vernunft</span> from the <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Deutsches\n              Textarchiv</span> corpus presents a philosophical tractate, originally published\n            in print, thus following 'traditional' book structure with front pages, foreword and\n            chapters. It can nevertheless demonstrate very well Publisher's capacities in\n            typesetting, switching between physical and logical structure of the document (just\n            toggle <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">Page View</span> in the <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">Settings</span> panel) as\n            well as generation of multiple output formats from single set of processing models in\n            the ODD (try choosing <span class=\"tei-parameter code\">PDF</span> or <span class=\"tei-parameter code\">ePub</span> options\n            in the <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">Download</span>). <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Purchas his pilgrimages</span>,\n            from the <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">EEBO-TCP</span> project, while roughly similar in structure is\n            much earlier work (1613) and demonstrates extensive use of marginal notes. </p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\"> Shakespeare's <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Romeo and Juliet</span>, from <span class=\"tei-emphasis2\">Bodleian First\n              Folio</span> project uses dedicated TEI elements to encode structure of the play\n            but it also showcases the parallel transcription and facsimile alignment for its\n            presentation which is obviously of general application and could be used for any genre,\n            not limited to dramatic texts. </p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">Correspondence corpora are common, yet very interesting, subjects for digital\n            editions.
