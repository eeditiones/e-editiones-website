A mechanism for project\n      specific language files extending the default Publisher label collection has been\n      added.</p><p class=\"tei-para\"> Thanks to community contributions via <a href=\"https://crwd.in/tei-publisher\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">\n        Crowdin</a> a number of languages has been added and existing ones are updated when\n      needed. We welcome and encourage additions and amendments. Please consider Crowdin a master\n      repository for translations and publish your contributions there instead of submitting PR\n      directly. Do not hesitate to get in touch if a language you'd like to support is not yet\n      listed. </p><p class=\"tei-para\"> Crowdin users are only exposed to form-based graphical user interface but i18n files are\n      using JSON format to preserve their logical structure. Initial portion of German localization\n      file <span class=\"tei-filename code\">de.json</span> is shown below for illustration. </p><figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n        <span class=\"tei--element\">\n          <img src=\"i18n-json-structure.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\">\n        </span>\n      </span><figcaption>Translation JSON file structure</figcaption></figure><p class=\"tei-para\"> In TEI Publisher and in generated apps translation files are by default loaded from CDN\n      with <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-components</span>.
