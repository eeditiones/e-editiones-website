It includes\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/eeditiones/teipublisher-docker-compose/tree/master/conf\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">configuration templates</a> for the nginx proxy. More general information about\n        proxy servers and eXist-db can be found in the article <a href=\"https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/production_web_proxying\" class=\"tei-link4\" target=\"_new\">Proxying eXist-db\n          behind a Web Server</a>.</p><p class=\"tei-para\">What does a proxy do for you? It can:</p><ol class=\"tei-orderedlist\"><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">handle domains and protect parts of the database you don't want external users to access. For example, you can\n            access the Escher edition using its <a href=\"https://www.briefedition.alfred-escher.ch/\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">public URL</a> and\n            you will directly land on the home page of the edition. What you can't see is that the Escher is just one out of several editions hosted\n            within the same eXist database. It is the proxy's job to direct you to the correct application\n            matching the public URL, so it appears to you as if there were only one edition. Other editions in the same\n            database are hidden and effectively protected.</p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">enforce a secured connection: communication between the users browser and the proxy will be secured by\n            HTTPS. And because all traffic is routed through the proxy, it is safe to keep the eXist database running on HTTP.</p>\n        </li><li class=\"tei-listitem\">\n          <p class=\"tei-para\">cache specific pages, so TEI Publisher does not need to transform TEI to HTML every time</p>\n        </li></ol><p class=\"tei-para\">In the following sections we'll discuss specific settings you should pay attention to when running TEI\n        Publisher behind a proxy.</p></pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
