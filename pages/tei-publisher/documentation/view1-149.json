The idea is to further simplify the work of editors when annotating documents via TEI Publisherâ€™s web-based annotation editor by automatically identifying potential candidates for people, places etc.</p>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">For named entity recognition to be available in the web-based annotation editor, a separate Python service\n        is needed: clone the <a href=\"https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-publisher-ner\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">tei-publisher-ner</a> repository and follow the instructions in the README.</p>\n      <figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n          <span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <img src=\"wikipedia.gif\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\">\n          </span>\n        </span><figcaption>NER in action</figcaption></figure>\n      <p class=\"tei-para\">One of the distinguishing features of this solution is that it makes it rather easy to train a recognition\n        model on your own data sets.
