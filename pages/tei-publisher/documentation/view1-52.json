Browser support for the corresponding CSS\n          specifications is not very good, but there are various tools to improve this. If you\n          select the print CSS download option for any of the documents in TEI Publisher, which\n          support it, you will be directed to a preview page. This page uses a library called <a href=\"https://pagedjs.org/\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">paged.js</a> to \"teach\" the browser how to handle\n          certain layout aspects. Thanks to this, using the <span class=\"tei-command code\">print page</span> dialog of\n          your browser will result in a much nicer page layout than if you just tried to print TEI\n          Publisher's document view.</p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">The preview page uses TEI Publisher's <span class=\"tei-code2 code\">pb-print-preview</span> web component.\n          This component will retrieve the full HTML of the document, enhanced with additional CSS\n          stylesheets for print, and passes it to paged.js for the page formatting. For testing\n          purposes you can also click on the bottom-most button with the <span class=\"tei-guibutton guibutton\">eye</span>\n          icon to see the raw HTML (without paged.js applied).</p>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">To generate the HTML of the document, the component calls Publisher's API endpoint:</p>\n\n        <pb-code-highlight class=\"tei-synopsis4\" language=\"\">/api/document/doc%2Fdocumentation.xml/print</pb-code-highlight>\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">The following (optional) parameters are supported:</p>\n        <dl><dt>base</dt><dd>\n              <p class=\"tei-para\">specifies the base URI for resolving relative links, e.g. to locate images</p>\n            </dd><dt>style</dt><dd>\n              <p class=\"tei-para\">one or more additional CSS stylesheet URLs to be imported into the page.</p>\n            </dd><dt>script</dt><dd>\n              <p class=\"tei-para\">one or more Javascript files to be loaded via <span class=\"tei-tag code\">script</span>.</p>\n            </dd><dt>wc</dt><dd>\n              <p class=\"tei-para\">if set, include TEI Publisher's web component libraries. You may need this if\n                you are using components like <span class=\"tei-tag code\">pb-code-highlight</span> (as in the documentation)</p>\n            </dd></dl>\n\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">For sure, being an open source project, paged.js does not support every fancy layout\n          you may wish for. For example, support for formatting footnotes will be limited. There are\n          other, mainly commercial tools, which you may use to generate PDF out of your HTML. Those\n          include e.g. <a href=\"https://www.princexml.com/\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">Prince XML</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pdfreactor.com/\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">PDF Reactor</a> or <a href=\"https://antennahouse.com/\" class=\"tei-link5\" target=\"\">Antennahouse</a>. Each of those may have\n          different strengths and weaknesses. Please try yourself.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"tei-para\">For command line tools, you can use the API endpoint described above to retrieve the\n          full HTML of the page and feed this to PrinceXML or whatever you want to use. To simplify\n          this, the preview page includes a button at the bottom: clicking it will copy the API\n          endpoint URL (excluding the page.js components, which would interfere with external\n          tools). The screenshot below shows princeXML's dialog into which you can paste the URL\n          provided by the preview page:</p>\n\n        <figure class=\"tei-figure2 figure\"><span class=\"tei--element\">\n            <span class=\"tei--element\">\n              <img src=\"prince-screenshot.png\" class=\"tei-imagedata2\" title=\"\">\n            </span>\n          </span><figcaption> Processing Print HTML with PrinceXML </figcaption></figure>\n      </pb-observable></div></div></body></html>",
