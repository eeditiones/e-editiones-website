In April 2021 e-editions have launched a series of regular community meetings that will be held on the first Tuesday of each month at 17:00 CET/CEST. <b>As of 12 June 2023 meetings will be held online on Teams. We will publish the respective link with the announcement of the event.</b>

<!--at [https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones](https://meet.existsolutions.com/eeditiones) and will not be recorded. Registration is not required to attend. -->

The objective of these meetings is to give the community a space to discuss topics and present editions, projects, challenges and solutions. Meetings will last one hour and a short presentation of the topic or the project will be followed by an open discussion.

We warmly invite you to propose topics at [info@e-editiones.org](info@e-editiones.org) for the future community meetings dates.
