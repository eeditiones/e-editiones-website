This release is the next big step towards our vision of a > tool which enables XML-savy scholars and editors to publish materials > without becoming programmers or forcing them into a one-size-fits-it-all > framework.   TEI Publisher goes Web Components  Past projects we realized could prove that the TEI Processing Model is indeed a truly universal and powerful tool for any kind of XML, not just TEI. However, creating an online edition requires more than just text transformation: the text needs to be embedded into an application context, adding navigation, pagination, search, facsimiles and so on. Moving towards the emerging web component standard, TEI Publisher 4.0 implements all this functionality as small \"lego\" blocks to be freely arranged, recombined and extended.  Earlier versions of TEI Publisher were limited to showing a single text view by default. Creating more complex layouts required at least basic XQuery, HTML and CSS skills. As showcased by the example documents, the new version allows users to realize custom views without actually writing code. Users can pick from a toolbox of ready-made components, including text views based on an ODD transformation, IIIF-powered image viewers, maps and many more. All those building blocks come as custom HTML elements, which are easy to write and configure. Each of them encapsulates a certain functionality and appearance. Have a look at the documentation and the web components API to see how to use components.   Open Source  We strongly believe in Open Source, standards and reusability. TEI Publisher is a major milestone towards our vision, but there's always more to be done and we would like to invite the community to contribute ideas, goals and implementations. Missing a certain functionality or component? Tell us.   Get It!  TEI Publisher 4.0 is available as an application package on top of the eXist XML Database. Install it into a recent eXist (4.x.x series) by going to the dashboard and selecting TEI Publisher from the package manager.  For more information refer to the documentation or visit the homepage to play around with it.   Thanks  Our special thanks go to the erabbinica.org project for funding a major part of the migration to web components.

Release Highlights: Dynamic Layout and Custom Translation Alignment  Many users were interested in the correspondence examples, in particular the Serafin and Cortés letters showing transcription and translation side by side. We have focused on enhancing those use cases and close some gaps in functionality. One problem arising in many TEI projects is how to align two or more texts, e.g. a transcription and a translation. In the simplest case, the texts may be aligned on the level of divisions or page breaks. Unfortunately things are not always as simple as that. TEI allows a wide variety of alignment mechanisms, some more complex than others. TEI Publisher 4.1.0 thus implements a generic mechanism to define a mapping function written in XQuery. This is a simple, yet powerful approach. The letter from Cortés to Dantiscus (Mexico) showcases a rather complex mapping.   Van Gogh: Dynamic, Multi Column Example  !  The Van Gogh edition is often considered a model example for correspondence and several users expressed their wish to create something similar with TEI Publisher. With recent release of XML sources for all the letters we've decided to use one letter from Van Gogh to Gauguin and try to reproduce the dynamic, user configurable, multi column display of the original Van Gogh website using the webcomponents provided by TEI Publisher. The corresponding webcomponents (`<pb-grid>/<pb-panel>`) have been reworked to make this possible.   Other New Features and Bug Fixes  - Sort and filter documents by title, author or file name  - Autocomplete suggestions are now displayed for all search boxes  - Allow arbitrary footnote labels to be passed via the @n parameter of   the note behaviour  - Support plain images to be displayed by `<pb-facsimile>` - if a IIIF   server is not needed or available  - Fix uploads of files containing spaces in their names   Get It!

Release Highlights: Facets  Facets allow users to quickly navigate through a result set by selecting from the list of predefined categories. This way, users can drill down into the set, reducing the number of displayed items with every step. As the user chooses a facet, the set necessarily becomes smaller, so non-matching entries will disappear from sight.  Facets are a new feature in eXist 5.0.0. They are *super fast* because eXist will create them when indexing the document. No extra computation is needed when the user clicks on a facet to drill down into a displayed set: all information is already available in the index. By default TEI Publisher configures two facets: *Genre* and *Language* while Van Gogh demo presents a more elaborate example of facets in action.   Van Gogh demo  !  The Van Gogh edition is often considered a model example for correspondence. Following the recent release of XML sources for all the letters we've decided to use this excellent resource to showcase the new faceting feature of eXist 5.0.0 as well as the dynamic, user configurable, multi column display of the original Van Gogh website using the webcomponents provided by TEI Publisher in a playful styling.   DOCX import  New docx module based on custom ODD for docx to TEI transformation is available to allow for importing documents in docx format, preserving their textual content, structure and basic semantics of the text. Due to the particularities of docx, reconstructing logical document structure can be only based on certain heuristics but TEI Publisher preserves basic document divisions and headings, lists, tables, embedded images, foot- and endnotes, as well as recognizing styles whose names start with `tei:` as TEI elements with the same name, e.g *Johann Wolfgang Goethe* styled with `tei:persName` style will be converted to `<persName>Johann Wolfgang Goethe</persName>`.   DTS API  TEI Publisher now implements a Distributed Text Services client and exposes core endpoints of DTS API. Custom `<dts-client>` component allows for browsing remote DTS server collections and documents which are rendered via TEI Publisher's ODD.  !   Main New Features and Bug Fixes  - Facets based document filtering  - DOCX (Word) document format import  - Draft implementation of the DTS API  - New pb-toggle-feature UI component for switching between two states of   a parameter passed to ODD, e.g. normalized and diplomatic view  - Coverage for embedding TEI Publisher output components in other   websites (e.g. WordPress)  - Remove dependency on monex and calls to deprecated map functions  - i18n: Performance improvements, support for multiple catalogue files   for a single language, Dutch translation  - Fix DocBook support for generated apps  - Simplify login configuration  - Use new field definitions for metadata in index config  - Support page breaks in non-TEI vocabularies   Get It!

Its goal is to empower digital editions of cultural, scientific, and artistic works by promoting open standards related to digital editions and advancing open source applications based on them.  While digital editions may differ considerably in structure and content, there is a large overlap in terms of the basic technical functionality that each edition must offer. Starting point for the initiators of the Society is their shared use of TEI Publisher – which originated from a project of the TEI community. This toolbox allows editions to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way.  However, such software requires a constant exchange between developers and users, who are familiar with the technical requirements of their respective edition projects. The Society would like to put this exchange of information as well as the communication between edition projects on a firm footing.   Focus of the Society  - Initiating and coordinating developments in open source software for digital editions - Promotion of information exchange and communication between the stakeholders involved - Fundraising for the purposes of the society - Ensuring long term availability of digital editions  A more detailed description can be found in our strategy paper.

Release Highlights: Word document import  Docx module introduced in 5.0.0 allows for importing documents in docx format, preserving their textual content, structure and basic semantics of the text. TEI Publisher preserves document's structural divisions and headings, lists, tables, embedded images, foot- and endnotes, as well as recognizes styles whose names start with tei: as TEI elements with the same name, e.g *Johann Wolfgang Goethe* styled with `tei:persName` style will be converted to `<persName>Johann Wolfgang Goethe</persName>`.  This release introduces a default convention for encoding additional attributes: text in angle brackets will be interpreted as a list of attribute-value pairs. Multiple items can be separated with a “;”. For example, to set a `@rend` and provide a `@ref` for a `placeName`, you can write `Frankfurt<rend=smallcaps;ref=Frankfurt am Main>`. This notation can be modified by extending the ODD with additional rules for project-specific workflow. For example, if persName does always need a `@ref` attribute in your edition, you could have a simplified rule which parses: `Friedrich Dürrenmatt<118527908>`.  Further conventions have been introduced to distinguish between different kinds of notes (e.g. editor's commentary, source annotations, and text-critical notes). Footnotes marked with a custom mark (to be found under *Format* \\> *Custom Mark* in Word's *Footnote Dialog*) are converted into note `n=\"custom mark\" type=\"original\"`.  Yet another mechanism, based on Word comments, can be leveraged to mark arbitrary spans of text. Word comments insert a start and end marker, which can be easily converted to TEI using `anchor` and `note` element combination and output accordingly later.  Please refer to the sample Word conversion document for detailed discussion of the import features and conventions.   Historical dictionary example: Bogactwa mowy polskiej  On a mission to provide a rich spectrum of examples showcasing different uses of TEI we're adding a small sample for a genre so far unrepresented in TEI Publisher - a 19th century manuscript collocative dictionary of Polish _Bogactwa mowy polskiej_ (_Riches of the Polish tongue_) by Alojzy Osiński, edited by Ewa Rudnicka.  This example features a transcription and facsimile parallel view with regions of interest highlighted in the facsimile panel thanks to the use of `pb-facs-link` component.  !

"},{"id":"/pages/strategy/","title":"Strategy","content":"  e-editiones: Focus of the Society  The focus of the the e-editiones society rests on 4 pillars:  1. Initiating and Coordinating Developments in Open Source Software for Digital Editions 2. Promotion of Information Exchange and Communication between the stakeholders involved 3. Fundraising for the purposes of the society 4. Ensuring long term availability of digital editions   1\\. Initiating and Coordinating Developments in Open Source Software for Digital Editions  The society promotes the use of open standards and open source software for digital editions. While digital editions may differ considerably in structure and content, there is great overlap in the basic technical functionality that each edition must offer. Small projects often face the challenge of publishing an edition under time pressure and with limited resources and would benefit from access to free, open source. standards-based software that could provide much of this functionality out of the box. All projects, including those that are well-resourced, would benefit from such software, by avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel and incur high development and maintenance costs, which threaten their long term sustainability.  The society therefore focuses on the promotion of open source, standard-based software. Editions should be able to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way, achieving quick solutions at low cost, but without being forced into a corset, neither technically nor scholarly.  The society therefore focuses on the promotion of open source, standard-based software. Editions should be able to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way, achieving quick solutions at low cost, but without being forced into a technical or scholarly corset. The starting point for the founders of the society is their shared use of TEI Publisher, which meets above conditions:  1. TEI Publisher is consistently based on TEI and related standards such as ODD and TEI Processing Model; 2. TEI Publisher is implemented as a toolbox: the entire user interface consists of small components complying with W3C standards, which can be recombined and reassembled as needed; 3. TEI Publisher supports exchange and communication between different editions; and 4. as a free, open source software project TEI Publisher enables and stimulates competition between commercial service providers serving the publishing industry.  The society thus initially aims to further support the development of TEI Publisher and TEI Publisher-based projects. However, such software cannot be created in isolation. Rather, it requires a constant exchange between developers and users, who are familiar with the technical requirements of their respective edition projects. This is how TEI Publisher originated—as an initiative of the TEI Community and has since been continuously developed in interaction with a large number of projects. The Society would like to provide a stable and productive forum for this exchange of information, but it does not limit itself specifically to TEI Publisher.  Direct communication between edition projects is also central: instead of having to solve the same problems over and over again, projects should benefit from the experience and developments of other editions. In most cases, the technical requirements of an edition can already be covered with existing building blocks. Where this does not suffice and new blocks are needed, edition projects should coordinate with others to avoid duplicate developments. If possible, new building blocks should be created in a generic way so that other editions can easily adapt them to their requirements. To do this, the project’s context has to be extended beyond the single edition and a broader perspective needs to be adopted.  It is a main objective of the society to coordinate such developments and channel existing funds or funding applications in a way that supports sustainability, from which all members derive long term benefits.   2\\. Promotion of Information Exchange and Communication between the stakeholders involved  A second important goal of the society is to promote a constant exchange of information between the members. This includes establishing a communication platform open to all members for questions, suggestions, and other contributions.  However, based on our experience with open source projects, we know that such communication only works in the long run if there are responsible individuals taking on a coordination role, overseeing requests, and, if necessary, referring communications to the right people. The society therefore intends to appoint a secretary who will take on these responsibilities and be available as a contact person for all members.  In addition to electronic communication, the society also plans workshops, seminars, and talks—or arranges these on request. It can often be assumed that the projects themselves have funds to cover travel costs. However, this is not always the case. The society should therefore be able to cover part of the costs from membership fees—e.g., travel expenses or a compensation for invited experts.  The society also actively seeks members and promotes sustainable solutions—e.g., through conference talks or workshops.   3\\. Fundraising for the purposes of the society  The society can support its members in writing project funding applications, or it can apply for funding itself and in this case represent the interests of all members. All software development shall be for the benefit of the general public and must be available for further use as open source.   4\\. Ensuring long term availability of digital editions  Especially for smaller edition projects with limited resources, hosting can be a massive problem. Running a server and maintaining the associated infrastructure is expensive and requires constant commitment, which likely extends beyond the planned duration of the project. And even if hosting is provided by an institutional service infrastructure, those institutions’ own resource constraints may limit their role to providing updates and minimal maintenance only, a tragic pattern that too often leads services to become partially or completely inaccessible after a few years.  The society is therefore committed to ensuring that public memory institutions (i.e., archives, libraries, and universities) provide the editions on a long-term basis. The society wants to dramatically lower the cost and effort for institutions charged with maintaining the editions. In early 2020, the swissuniversities project, Nationale Infrastruktur Editionen (NIE-INE), sponsored improvements to TEI Publisher to facilitate long-term updates and enable shared hosting of heterogeneous edition projects on one platform. The society also assists edition projects to secure a (public) provider for the time after the completion of the funding period and plan for the long-term archiving of the project’s raw data.  Since the entire software is freely available, it is also possible for infrastructure providers to set up a corresponding service. The society explicitly welcomes and supports this.

Release Highlight: User Interface Components as an Independent Library  Publisher's library of web components is now distributed via npm. Thanks to the increasing support for the web component standards in modern browsers, the heavier framework used before (Polymer) could be dropped and has been replaced by LitElement, which is just a thin wrapper around native web components. While invisible to users, this redesign greatly improves modularity of Publisher-based applications.  Thanks to npm releases, updating the user interface for all Publisher-based apps becomes simply a question of changing a single variable in the configuration file.  Furthermore, Publisher's library of web components - true to the basic idea of Web Components Standard - can be included in any HTML webpage. This means it can be embedded into existing CMS or any other publishing solution, even if it's not running eXist-db (e.g. the popular Hugo or WordPress). A few lines of HTML is sufficient to embed a document view anywhere you like:  <iframe scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"\" height=\"480\" title=\"undefinedl\" src=\"https://codepen.io/wolfgangmm/embed/GRJyvNY?height=480&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result&editable=true\">Loading codepen ...</iframe>  Similarly, if you prefer to write your own application using any of the popular frameworks like angular, vue or react you can easily import the pb-components package and use it directly in your project.  As a final consequence, this change decouples the component library from the TEI Publisher app. It is now possible to host multiple applications, which depend on different versions of the component library, without conflict, within the same eXist-db instance, a point of importance for institutions with numerous projects.   Main New Features and Bug Fixes  - Redesigned and simplified CSS styling customization    Styling properties are now exposed via standard CSS files and theme   variables. Stylesheets can also be specified within the ODD, as   previously, or through `pb-view` component configuration attributes.  - Extended internationalization    - full i18n support for all the labels in HTML templates and within     web components    - mechanism for project specific language files extending the default     Publisher collection    - a number of new languages added and existing ones updated. Currently     TEI Publisher is fully translated into Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch,     French, Georgian, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian, Polish,     Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish     and Ukrainian.  - Subcorpora - new TEI Publisher data organization    Publisher's pre-populated data collection is now split into Playground   and TEI Publisher demo collection areas which illustrate how this   mechanism could be used to host multiple subcorpora within single TEI   Publisher application.  - New and improved web components    - `pb-select-feature` and `pb-toggle-feature` components have been     extended to allow for interactive changing of display parameters     (like switching between regularized or original spelling) which can     be then processed client or server-side    - new API documentation     app     and web component demo pages    - pb-mei     component for rendering Music Encoding Initiative documents based on     Verovio; supports optional MIDI playback using web-midi-player      !  - Redesigned ODD editor providing an improved user experience  - Documentation:    - reorganized and extended TEI Publisher documentation    - pb-components API documentation and demos   Get It!

Giuliano Di Bacco and Dennis Ried introduced us to MEI and challenges of publishing MEI and MEI-in-TEI collections on the web (see slides). Wolfgang Meier presented early results of his work on integration of MEI into the TEI Publisher.  !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@marius?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Marius Masalar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/music?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>    As we learned from Giuliano's and Dennis' introduction _MEI, like the TEI, is an umbrella term which simultaneously describes an organization, a research community, and a markup language_ (music-encoding.org). It's almost 20 years since the first public presentation of the XML schema created by Perry Roland (Univ. of Virginia) for the representation of music notation. Now it has become a thriving community of around 400 members worldwide, specialists from various music research groups, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists.  This open-source effort to define guidelines for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure draws in many aspects on TEI: using an ODD metalanguage to define both the schema and encoding guidelines, dividing the document into metadata, facsimile and text parts, recording logical and structural divisions of the document (albeit named differently) or \"borrowing\" a number of element names from TEI to deal with metadata, textual content, critical apparatus, linking etc.  Nevertheless, MEI was designed to specialize in the encoding of music documents, therefore MEI data is predominantly about the meaning of the music notation: notes, rests, chords, measures. That said MEI allows for multiple additional layers of annotations:  - about the visual aspects of the notation, and/or of the features of a physical copy of a score - metadata - editorial markup  While MEI encoding allows for sophisticated analysis of various features of the musical piece, rendering of MEI documents often poses a substantial challenge. We need to consider that music notation is a very complex system; actually, many systems were developed since the medieval times, and MEI strives to give a sophisticated representation not only of the symbols but of their meaning and of the logic that brings them together in pieces of music of all ages. However, it is still difficult, if not impossible, to render graphically all the nuances of the encoding.  Major breakthrough in this respect has been the creation of the Verovio music engraving library which is considered the most advanced solution in the field to generate score visualisations in SVG.  Verovio is quite helpful to render the notation for the most common use cases for MEI:  - to create transcriptions/editions of music pieces - to produce bibliographies and catalogs  Difficulties arise when we need to deal with mixed textual and musical content: from music treatises (see Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum), composers’ letters quoting musical phrases, to opera librettos and listening guides, papers including snippets of music notation (e.g. music textbooks)... Such situations often require the simultaneous use of both TEI and MEI (and for instance a MEI file can be referenced in a TEI document using the \\`\\` element). Giuliano and Dennis walked us through a number of different approaches employed in various projects, where tools specialized just for a single vocabulary do not meet their ideal criteria for broad application:  - ease of setting up - TEI and MEI support - facsimile integration  Following this cue, Wolfgang has demonstrated his new pb-mei web component which uses Verovio under the hood to generate SVG representation of the score. For TEI documents applying \\`\\` element to include a pointer to a MEI encoding of a music notation it is very straightforward to adjust the ODD to transform this pointer to a pb-mei component, as demonstrated in the pb-mei demo.  !Demo page of the pb-mei component  This proved to be a very pleasant surprise and a convincing argument that TEI Publisher could be adapted to fit the needs of MEI community. A short discussion followed ranging from detailed questions on MEI encoding, through workflows on creating MEI sources cf. Verovio editor to information important for preparing an ODD and customization modules for supporting MEI in TEI Publisher. We agreed to work with Giuliano and Dennis on including MEI-in-TEI and pure MEI examples in the next minor version of the TEI Publisher to demonstrate fully its capability.  We were happy to see that this event gathered the audience of around 17 participants and are looking forward to establishing a monthly meetup online to provide an arena for lively discussions on subjects of interest to the community.

The event will take place online at 4pm CET on October 20th, 2020.  Many of us at some point expressed their frustration with starting a TEI project. Without previous experience with this extensive and robust vocabulary the learning curve may be quite steep and the whole process overwhelming.  TEI Vanilla is a grassroots movement to help newcomers to the TEI community in smooth on-boarding. We feel that a number of prospective users, both individual and institutional, would benefit from a gentler introduction than TEI's excellent but extensive Guidelines provide.  Vanilla is meant to pick up where earlier 2015 TEI Simple project, led by the late Sebastian Rahtz, Martin Mueller and Brian Pytlik-Zillig, left off. As some of you would remember, main outcome of the TEI Simple was the TEI Processing Model, now lying at the heart of the TEI Publisher. Nevertheless, the other goal envisioned for Simple was creating a schema which would provide a good starting point for majority, if not most, larger scale editorial projects. We based our selection on a survey of usage through large volume corpora, among them EEBO-TCP and DTA, and believed it to be a solid 80/20 solution: addressing 80% of users needs with 20% of the effort and heartache.  Thanks to the space for discussion on e-editiones Slack we found out there are many like-minded individuals willing to join forces in the work of reviewing the schema and working on its own dedicated Guidelines and a body of examples, tutorials and other auxiliary resources.  At this point we would like to share our motivations and preliminary goals but above all solicit opinions, perspectives and requirements from our community.

Release Highlight: Open API  Version 7 represents the logical next step on our mission to improve interoperability, sustainability and long-term maintenance of editions created with TEI Publisher. While version 6 addressed the client side by extracting all webcomponents into a separate package, version 7 applies a similar redesign to the server side:  1.  It exposes a well-defined, clear API specification     following the Open API standard. Understanding how exactly TEI     Publisher routes requests through the various layers was often     challenging. With the new API we have a single, well-documented     entry point to which you can also add your own functionality.  2.  Updating becomes much easier due to defined API versions, clear     configuration and separation of concerns  3.  The API can be easily accessed by other software outside TEI     Publisher or its webcomponents, say, for example, Python or R     scripts  !  The basis of this redesign is the new OAS-Router library, which reads a service specification following the Open API standard and maps incoming requests to the XQuery library implementing the actual functionality. By using Open API we can benefit from a wide choice of tools and utilities available for many programming languages.  Users can extend or modify the API by adding their own endpoints to `custom-api.json`. Open API allows you to describe all the details of an API call (i.e. parameters, response codes etc.), so your XQuery code can concentrate on implementing the actual functionality without having to bother with parameter or response types.  Furthermore, every API operation is independently tested against the specification, to assure that e.g. parameter and response types correspond exactly to the definition. For this our main Git repositories now use a sophisticated setup for running automated tests.   Other Improvements  The webcomponent library saw a number of important bug fixes and improvements. Despite the API changes, the library is fully backwards compatible: it first checks which version of TEI Publisher is running on the server and adjusts accordingly.  Among other things we improved the component handling file uploads, introduced a way to navigate back to the parent collection of a document being viewed, fixed bugs in the visual ODD editor, the search component and many others.   Upgrading  While version 7 tries to ensure that future updates will become much smoother, upgrading to 7 does still require a few manual steps, which are described in the documentation.   Get It!

Nevertheless, there was a shared agreement on certain shortcomings in the availability of:  - introductory and advanced material for self-study - curated repository of extensive examples in different languages and covering different domains - critical commentary focusing on the bigger picture and decision making through the whole process: from encoding to publishing  Similarly, we agreed during the meeting, that a particular customization tied to a schema, following the path of TEI Lite or TEI Simple is at the moment a secondary concern. Rather a “kleine Katechismus”, presenting main concepts and considerations in a linear progression is sorely missed. Naturally, there’s no single path through the richness of the TEI but we imagine such an introductory guide would embrace the 80/20 approach and focus on issues relevant for virtually all projects.  All these postulates are not new and there is a lot of diverse material dispersed through the web already. TEI website and wiki pages try to point its user towards projects, tools and tutorials. Nevertheless, these lists, or resources they refer to, are often dated or fragmentary, therefore do not give an adequate overview, particularly of emerging practices.  It is obvious that gathering and preparing resources helpful for broad spectre of TEI users is a task both daunting as well as never-ending, and can only be undertaken and then maintained within the interested communities of practice themselves. e-editiones society sees its important role in providing a space for publication and coordinating efforts on preparation of guides, tutorials and best practice recommendations for digital editions and would like to invite you to submit proposals for:  - guest blog posts on e-editiones.org covering various aspects of preparing and publishing a digital edition - TEI-encoded samples for various domains - accompanying ODD schema and processing model customizations  You can discuss and submit proposals via TEI Vanilla issue tracker.  PS We hoped to provide a recording of our online meeting and did not minute it. Unfortunately, due to a technical glitch, the recording quality is insufficient for publication. I am very sorry for this and would like to encourage other participants to share their perspectives, opinions and points for discussion I might have missed in this summary.

For the Karl Barth edition project, we have thus created a new extension for Visual Studio Code (vscode) and published it as Open Source.   Where it all started: a Word plugin  Within the Karl Barth edition, texts to be published in new volumes are encoded in Microsoft Word and transformed to TEI using TEI Publisher's powerful docx2TEI conversion feature based on the TEI processing model.  To simplify semantic encoding, eXist Solutions created a **Word plugin** for the project, which allows editors to easily encode entities occurring within the text: select a string representing an entity, click a button and the plugin will run a query against the database of the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, showing potential matches for each possible category.  With another click, the selected entity is inserted into the Word document, including a reference to the entity in the database. This proved to be a huge timesaver: what took minutes before - switching to a different window, doing a search and copying the ID - is now done in seconds. A screenshot of the Word plugin is shown below:  !MS Word screenshot  The plugin also allows editors to get a preview of how the current text would look like in TEI and how it would be rendered to HTML by TEI Publisher's ODD-based transformations. The preview feature sends the underlying Word XML to a TEI Publisher instance, which transforms it first to TEI, and then - if requested - to HTML. Editors can thus see the text as it would later appear on the website.   Porting it to Visual Studio Code  However, the Word-workflow only covers the new volumes: we still have 54 already published volumes in TEI, which need to be extended. Parts of this is done automatically (via entity detection), but there's still a lot of manual editing involved. Thus the question arised if the Word plugin could be ported to an XML editor.  For sure, oXygen would have been the obvious choice, but since the Word Plugin was already written in javascript/typescript, we decided to give Visual Studio Code a try. It turned out to be rather straightforward and the first usable version was done within one evening. Thrilled by the success, we invested two more days to make the plugin more generic, in particular, add connectors for other authority databases. Beyond the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, we now have connectors for the German GND, metagrid, Geonames and Google places.  !Enity lookup screencast  The TEI snippet to be inserted for each of the entity types can be configured in the settings. For example, you could replace `<persName>` with `<name type=\"person\">` if you like.   Previews  The HTML preview feature has been ported as well: pressing a keyboard shortcut or clicking the toolbar icon will present you with a list of ODDs available for transformations, and then open a new editor panel showing the transformation result in HTML. All you need is a TEI Publisher 7 instance which has a matching ODD installed. The plugin uses the general API introduced with TEI Publisher 7, which will also be exposed automatically by any application generated from it.  !HTML preview screencast   Snippets  Finally, it is rather straightforward to create reusable snippets in vscode. To start with, we implemented the one shortcut we use most in oXygen and miss everywhere else: wrap the current selection with an element (the Scholarly XML extension described below also has this, but it doesn't hurt to have it twice in case you're not using that).  And since we have to encode a lot of foreign texts, we also added one for `<foreign>`. Doing more would be easy: maybe you have some suggestions? Just write them into our github issues.   Combine with other extensions  If you combine this with other extensions available on the vscode marketplace, you get rather decent XML editing support - not as sophisticated as with oXygen, but good enough for some serious work.  For schema-based validation and context sensitive suggestions one can choose between two extensions: Scholary XML is lightweight and provides nice suggestions with documentation. It only understands relax-ng though and does not support catalogs, which means you need to reference the schema via a processing instruction in every TEI file. The second option, XML Language Support by Red Hat, supports XML schema and catalogs, which you can use to associate the TEI namespace with a schema once and for all. On the downside, it uses more system resources as it starts a background Java process.  To set up a catalog, just create a file `catalog.xml` somewhere with e.g. the following content and change the vscode configuration property `xml.catalogs` to point to it:    Finally, if you use TEI Publisher as a basis for your own editions, you definitely want to install the Language Server and Client for XQuery/eXistdb. It supports working on XQuery files, syncing your local changes with the database, installing XAR files and more.   Get it  The extension is available from Microsoft's Visual Studio Marketplace. To install it in your own Visual Studio Code, just open the _Extensions_ tab and search for `tei-publisher-vscode`.  All source code is available on the e-editiones github and we would like to invite others to further extend it, e.g. by adding connectors to other authority APIs. Connectors are simple javascript/typescript classes with just two methods. See the existing connectors for inspiration.  If you have questions, suggestions or would like to discuss further extensions: you'll find us in the e-editiones slack rooms.

This is the second release coordinated by e-editiones and another important step to improve interoperability, sustainability and long-term maintenance of editions created with TEI Publisher. While release 6 came with a major redesign of the client side parts of TEI Publisher, version 7 focusses on the server, featuring a clean and extensible API based on the Open API standard.  !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@marcel_eberle?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Marcel Eberle</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/seven?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>    The plan for TEI Publisher 7 (and 6 before) was born during a meeting in Basel in November last year, when some of the Swiss edition projects using TEI Publisher came together to discuss how the software could be developed into an even more sustainable platform. Many of them became founding members of e-editiones a few months later.  Fortunately the Swiss Nationale Infrastruktur für Editionen - Infrastructure nationale pour les éditions agreed to support the outlined ideas, funding a substantial part of the work. Other member projects contributed time and money, and served as testbeds for the new versions.  TEI Publisher 7 is thus more than just another technological milestone - it is the product of a cooperative development model in which users, researchers, institutions and developers work hand in hand towards a shared goal.  We're looking forward to continue this success story next year and would again like to invite everybody to become part of it. Support the common cause by becoming a member, convince your institutions to take part, and contribute in one of the many possible ways.  Read the full release notes on the TEI Publisher website.

Release Highlight: Open API  Version 7 represents the logical next step on our mission to improve interoperability, sustainability and long-term maintenance of editions created with TEI Publisher. A major redesign to the server side allowed us to expose a well-defined, clear API specification following the Open API standard. Integrated Swagger UI allows you to visualize and interact with the API’s resources. Read more in 7.0.0 Release Candidate notice.  The API can be easily extended to cover project-specific functionality.  !   Release Highlight: Markdown support  In addition to various XML vocabularies, like TEI or DocBook, you can now use Markdown format. Markdown documents with `.md` extension will be correctly rendered via marked library. This feature is particularly useful for static content, like introductory material or project news.   Release Highlight: Flexible collection configuration  Previous versions of TEI Publisher allowed the view configuration to be specified either on the app level, through default odd, template and related variables in `modules/config.xqm`, or on the document level via processing instructions. Current version extends the application configuration mechanism in the `$config:collection-config` allowing for specifying view parameters per collection or document with arbitrary filtering expression (e.g. only documents in a certain language or of a particular type) without the need to change documents themselves.   Other Improvements  The webcomponent library saw a number of important bug fixes and improvements. Despite the API changes, the library is fully backwards compatible: it first checks which version of TEI Publisher is running on the server and adjusts accordingly.  Among other things we improved the component handling file uploads, introduced a way to navigate back to the parent collection of a document being viewed, switched to xml:id based navigation where available, fixed bugs in the visual ODD editor, the search component and many others.  Furthermore we have fixed some issues with DocBook configuration, introduced more sensible defaults for indexing and sorting and streamlined naming conventions of commonly customized modules. Support for nested footnotes has been improved.  Publisher 7 is available in 20 languages and we'll be happy to collaborate on extending the coverage for other, especially non-European languages. Extended FAQ section has been moved to an external site, automatically generated from markdown files stored in tei-publisher-faq repository. Quick edits are possible via GitHub, all contributions are welcome.   Upgrading  While version 7 tries to ensure that future updates will become much smoother, upgrading to 7 does still require a few manual steps, which are described in the documentation.   Get It!  TEI Publisher 7.0.0 is available as an application package on top of the eXist XML Database. Install it into a recent eXist (5.0.0 or newer) by going to the dashboard and selecting TEI Publisher from the package manager.  For more information refer to the documentation or visit the homepage to play around with it.

Usually the problem to solve would be the great diversity of encoding across projects, even if they all use TEI as a vocabulary of choice. Even commonly represented information, like the language of the source document, can be stored in various locations in a TEI document. Lucene-based fields and facets, introduced in eXist-db 5.0 provide a mechanism to smoothly abstract away these encoding differences - we can just define, say, a _language_ facet and it's the collection index configuration's role to take care of specifying where exactly to grab data from.  The next potential issue would be actually running the queries across corpora, particularly with the decentralized infrastructure where editions are hosted on diverse servers. The answer here is to define an API which individual editions need to expose, so that the aggregate search engine can just poll all its registered 'members', regardless of their location or how they implement the search internally.  !Cross-search results page  The cross-search prototype is exactly such a search engine. With a simple configuration one can register all 'member' editions. Only requirement for the editions themselves is that they expose the `api/search/document` API endpoint, which is a matter of simple customization for all TEI Publisher 7 applications which support Open API specifications out of the box. The `api/search/document` endpoint must accept a number of parameters defined in the specification. For this prototype the title, author and lang(uage) fields as well as genre, language and corpus facets were assumed.  We are very happy to report that our prototype works really well as a proof of concept with the eclectic collection of documents from TEI Publisher demo apps, all originating with vastly different projects with diverse encoding styles. Next, we intend to extend this idea into a general portal for archives and libraries and we would welcome collaboration from such institutions.  Our sincere thanks go to the Bibliothek für Bildungsgeschichtliche Forschung des DIPF / Research Library for the History of Education at DIPF for supporting this project.","tags":["announcements","interoperability","osa20","tei","tei-publisher"]},{"id":"/posts/roaster-an-open-api-router-for-exist/","title":"Roaster: an Open API Router for eXist","content":" !{.left width=220} We're happy to announce that the request routing library, which was originally developed for TEI Publisher 7, has been released as a separate package with extended functionality. The library, called **roaster**, is generic and can be used for any eXist-based project. It implements the Open API 3.0 standard to support well-documented, versioned and formally specified APIs.   Background  In previous versions of TEI Publisher, clients (i.e. your web browser) would communicate with the server by directly calling a variety of XQuery scripts. The server-side API, if you can even call it one, was thus scattered over many different files. Finding your way through the code, figuring out what parameters are expected or how the response should look like was rather difficult. Overwriting the default behaviour - e.g. to replace the generated table of contents - required substantial coding skills. The scripts also changed between TEI Publisher versions. So, if you were working on a standalone edition generated from Publisher, updates could be tricky.  With TEI Publisher 7, the entire server-side API can be viewed on a single documentation page. It clearly describes the URL paths you can use, as well as any parameter you can pass in and the type it should conform to. One can also see the different possible responses and what kind of content they would return.   The new API  Looking at the first route of the _documents_ section in the API (see screenshot below), it is easy to construct a URL which returns the source XML: the path template to use is `/api/document/{id}` and `{id}` should contain the path to a document - relative to the data root of TEI Publisher.  !Documents API screenshot  So to retrieve the TEI/XML for _Graves' letter_, located in the file path `test/graves6.xml`, we can use the following URL:  https://tei-publisher.org/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml  Note that the / in the path needs to be URL encoded with `%2F`. This is a requirement of the Open API specification.  If instead of the TEI/XML we would like to see the letter rendered to HTML, we can use the third route in the list and simply add `/html` to the end of the URL:  https://tei-publisher.org/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml/html  or if we prefer a PDF:  https://tei-publisher.org/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml/pdf  For sure, as an ordinary user, you don't need to know any of this: using the web interface of TEI Publisher, the web components on the page take care of constructing and calling above URLs for you. But if you are a developer, having a well-defined API is a game changer. Just imagine that you want to support your co-workers with a script which allows them to preview a local TEI document as HTML on the fly: sending the content of the document with an HTTP POST request to `/api/preview` is all you need! Our Visual Studio Code plugin does it like this.  You can use any script or programming language you like, say bash, python, perl - you name it. And because Open API is a widely used standard, there are plenty of tools for documentation, testing or code generation. The API documentation page in TEI Publisher is generated by such a tool (Swagger UI).   Implementation  **roaster** is essentially an implementation of the Open API standard in pure XQuery. It reads the formal API specification (in JSON format) and determines for each HTTP request coming in, which route to take. It will also check if the parameters, headers or request bodies passed in comply to the rules given in the definition of the route. An error will be generated if the request is not in compliance with the definition, e.g. because a required parameter is missing or has a wrong type. It can also fill in default values for parameters, enforce correct content types for the response etc.  From a developer perspective, this means you don't have to worry about parameters. Your handler function will receive a single parameter, containing all the necessary information about the request and you can safely assume that it complies with the spec you provided.  If you are interested in the details, please refer to the README. For a TEI Publisher-related example, check out the FAQ article, which describes how to replace the default table of contents with a custom one.  Roaster 1.0.0 can be installed into your local eXist via the package manager in the dashboard. TEI Publisher 7 shipped with a slightly older version, 0.5.1., but you can run both versions side by side.","tags":["announcements","open-api","roaster","release"]},{"id":"/posts/newsletter-2021-1/","title":"Newsletter 21/1","content":" !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bank_phrom?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Bank Phrom</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/news?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>  We're happy to send our first newsletter covering the past year of activities and developments within e-editiones and would like to encourage institutions or individuals who are not yet members to join forces.   e-editiones as a Society  The e-editiones society was founded on 4 May 2020 by more than 20 international partners.

TEI Publisher Developments: Versions 6 and 7  In 2020 two major versions of TEI Publisher were released: versions 6 and 7. The plan for these versions was born during a meeting in Basel in November 2019, when several Swiss edition projects using TEI Publisher came together to discuss how the software could be developed into an even more sustainable platform. A number of them later became founding members of e-editiones. Their primary goal was to enable institutions to manage and maintain a larger number of editions, either on the same or several servers. To reduce maintenance costs, keeping editions up to date with newer TEI Publisher versions needed to be as simple as possible. Editions relying on different versions needed to be able to run alongside each other.  Two areas had to be addressed to achieve these goals:  1. On the **client side** TEI Publisher was already a collection of small, modular web components, which together formed the user interface. These components had to be extracted into a separate library, so projects could benefit from bug fixes and new components without having to update the rest of the edition's application. 2. On the **server side** TEI Publisher needed a well defined API. Such an API would provide a standardized communication channel, through which the web components on the client could talk to the server. To accommodate future updates and support backwards compatibility, the API would need to be versioned, ensuring that both sides could speak the same language.  Fortunately the _Swiss Nationale Infrastruktur für Editionen – Infrastructure nationale pour les éditions_ agreed to support the outlined ideas, funding a substantial part of the work.  With the release of TEI Publisher 7, both areas mentioned above have been addressed and the goal has been fully reached.  Contributions also came from member institutions: the Collection of Swiss Law Sources Online and the St. Galler Missiven were built on an early version of TEI Publisher 4. Both funded a major update of their code to version 7. A number of regressions and new bugs were encountered during the migration, and appropriate fixes were contributed back into the TEI Publisher code base.  The Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe likewise served as a test bed during TEI Publisher 7 development. Furthermore, the Karl Barth project financed the Microsoft Word to TEI transformation, which is now part of TEI Publisher.  The source code of TEI Publisher and its related repositories have been moved under the roof of e-editiones and are hosted within its GitHub organization.   Other Software Packages  Beyond TEI Publisher itself, e-editiones released a number of other software packages:  - The Open API routing library at the heart of TEI Publisher 7, called Roaster, proved to be useful even outside the humanities and has already been adopted by a project in the medical realm. - Born out of the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, e-editiones published an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor to help editors work on TEI. This includes an entity explorer to help with the markup of entities in a text by querying external authority databases from within the XML editor. - The Cross Search package provides a blueprint for a portal incorporating multiple editions, supporting cross-edition search facilities. This will become the basis for future hosting services.   Community Contributions  Last but not least, we would like to point out the many contributions we received with respect to translations: TEI Publisher has now been translated to more than 20 languages!  We hope to see similar interest in other areas, e.g., the newly established FAQ website. We would like to encourage everyone to add entries and turn this into a knowledge base for all users. It already hosts questions and answers concerning encoding, workflows, or best practice recommendations.   The Future  Continuing our cooperative development model, the following new components and features are scheduled to appear in the forthcoming minor version of TEI Publisher:  - A component for displaying mathematical formulae, sponsored by the Bernoulli project (Uni Basel). - A feature to automatically register persistent DOI identifiers with every resource uploaded to TEI Publisher (financed by the DIPF).  e-editiones is actively apply for funding: a first proposal has been sent to a Swiss foundation, and we're waiting for feedback. The features we hope to obtain sponsorship for include:  - Better navigation within an edition by allowing arbitrary identification schemes for resources. - Speaking and bookmarkable URLs. - Improved accessibility. - A timeline component. - Components to improve the editorial workflow:     - Git integration into the user interface for synchronization.     - An annotation feature allowing editions to perform semantic markup tasks directly on the rendered text.  If you have other features on your list, please do not hesitate to propose them. We can achieve more at lower costs if we all work together. If you need a certain feature and plan to apply for funding, why not ask other projects which may have similar requirements? e-editiones is a welcoming umbrella under which your project can come together with other projects from different academic disciplines, coordinate needs, and potentially convince funding agencies to look beyond the perspective of a single project.

It is offering comprehensive, long-term support and maintenance to keep digital editions from going dark. The offer is **available to all interested editions** world-wide.  The offer will be complemented by a portal, which allows users to search across all editions participating in the service. The portal application has been developed by e-editiones, Archives Online and the Staatsarchiv Zürich, and will go online as soon as the first editions are ready for publication. All code will be made available as free software. The distributed search feature was based on earlier work financed by the DIPF Berlin (Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education), and the Karl Barth-Gesamtausgabe supported the server set up and automation.  The goal is to provide an easy, long-term hosting option for editions based on minimal, well-documented requirements: ultimately any edition which complies with the recommended practices can benefit from the hosting offer and participate in the portal service.  If you are interested in having an edition hosted, please contact Archives Online. The service will not be for free: any serious long-term hosting has to cover certain maintenance costs if it wants to follow more than an \"install and forget\" policy. But we're confident that our solution minimizes the costs while providing the best possible service, in particular if you're looking towards long-term availability.   Technical Background  e-editiones central goal is to provide editions with a sustainable publishing solution which ensures long term availability with minimal maintenance. With the redesign of TEI Publisher 6 and 7, we prepared the necessary technical foundations: all editions generated by TEI Publisher now share a common API.  With the new version 7 it became possible to:  1. host multiple editions created with different versions of the libraries side by side, 2. simplify the update procedure to make sure editions benefit from new developments while keeping maintenance costs very low, 3. search across local and distributed editions (hosted on a different server) by leveraging the shared API  Also, despite looking different on the surface, the building blocks for any TEI Publisher-based edition are the same, which allows server administrators to create automated setup and maintenance routines.   Outlook  Among many other things, TEI Publisher 8 will further improve the architecture by introducing more generic concepts for persistent URLs, navigation and addressing documents, allowing editions to use an addressing scheme which better reflects the logic of the edition rather than technical requirements.  A direct integration with git will allow editions to update published data without having to touch the command line.  The upcoming version will also include index configuration and API endpoints for local and distributed portal search, so generated editions can automatically participate in a multi-edition portal like sources-online.  With these low-level technical questions solved, e-editiones is now also putting a strong focus on describing the practical recommendations for the encoding of texts. The idea is to create a set of best practice guidelines for corpora with a pledge that any text following these guidelines will look good out of the box when rendered via TEI Publisher and will be ready for incorporation into the search portal. Initial work is carried out now and we expect a community meetup soon to discuss on a broader forum.  This way we aim to: flatten the learning curve for many projects starting with TEI encoding, reduce the amount of customization work required for an edition, allowing users to publish materials with minimal effort, and assure that the project data is ready to be integrated into larger scale search portals. Needless to say, recommendations we have in mind are intended only with an eye towards interoperability and do not limit in any way customization capacities already embodied by the TEI Publisher approach.","tags":["announcements","e-editiones","hosting","tei-publisher"]},{"id":"/pages/member-directory/","title":"Member Directory","content":" \\[profilepress-member-directory id=\"1\"\\] "},{"id":"/posts/contributing-to-tei-publisher-a-gentle-introduction/","title":"Contributing to TEI Publisher - a gentle introduction","content":" Talk by Wolfgang Meier (eXist Solutions) on Tuesday, the 6th of July 2021 at 17:00 CEST.

This paper, just presented at the virtual TEI conference, aims to demonstrate how critically important aspects of an edition can be reconstructed from a rather minimal data set and how such a _survival kit_ can be useful not only for disaster recovery but also as a sustainable approach for the maintenance of scholarly publications.  !Poster for 2021 TEI Conference by Magdalena Turska  The following schemata are the key components of the _survival kit_:  - Source documents - Document encoding and transformation scheme - Layout templates - Interoperable metadata mapping specification  TEI is the perfect archival format for text-centric data: human readable and easy to process - as long as we have the capacity to read text files we can recover the information from a repository of TEI texts. TEI encoded documents with an associated ODD schema and documentation already form a solid basis for reconstruction even if the ODD would say nothing about the final form of the publication as intended by the editors.  !TEI source and rendition via the Processing Model  The TEI Processing Model covers part of this territory, describing how a source document should be transformed for publication. Nevertheless, in the virtual realm, the document is always accompanied by a certain context on the page: controls to zoom in or out, facing facsimile image or switch between normalized and original spellings, just to name a few options. To explicitly define such a context and specify how a publication page would look and behave we can rely on HTML5 layout templates. A modern, web components based approach to website design gives us a beautifully simple and expressive method of assembling web pages from a virtual Lego block equivalent.  !HTML5 page layout using web components  The last missing piece is to document how abstract concepts, e.g. author or date of creation are realized in the encoding so we can recover and use them for queries within the publication as well as for data interchange with other systems. Given the richness of TEI it’s impossible to prescribe what metadata needs to be gathered and how exactly it should be encoded in any given project. On the other hand, it is rather simple to express the mapping in XML, e.g. with an index configuration syntax.  !Sample index configuration with fields and facets  Such a set of specifications preserves all the information necessary to rebuild the edition from scratch, focusing on the intentions and decisions of the editor while filtering out the ephemeral or secondary presentation aspects. Good to put in the vault and send into space but equally useful when the time to migrate to a new infrastructure comes.  !Original Dodis layout  How does it work in practice? You might want to have a closer look at one of the TEI Publisher's demo apps _When the Wall came Down_ which we managed to recreate on the basis of TEI sources and accompanying ODD released by Dodis on the 30th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. We managed to get a draft version in only 165 lines of custom code and during just one day of pre-conference workshop. Our task would be still simpler if we also had the web page template and index configuration available.  !Recreated document view  Given that there's barely an extra effort involved in assembling the survival kit, preparing it is a clear win. After all, we already have the sources and the ODD! Enriching it with a processing model is not particularly difficult, especially if we use it to generate our transformations. Similarly, in most database systems we will need to prepare the index configurations. At this point we probably don't need to mention that TEI Publisher already implements this approach since quite a few versions (ODD with the processing model from inception, web components for user interface since version 4 and fields and facets since version 5).  Just think about it, if you pack your edition nicely, it becomes a present which archives and libraries would very much like to keep safe in their vaults and running on their servers forever...","tags":["report","best practice","tei-publisher"]},{"id":"/posts/tei-conference-2021-talk-flexible-browser-based-annotations-for-tei/","title":"TEI Conference 2021 Talk: \"Flexible, Browser-Based Annotations for TEI\"","content":" Wolfgang Meier and Joe Wicentowski explain the web-based annotation feature introduced with TEI Publisher 7.1.

Very often they use the provided encoding examples and re-use code snippets to build their own custom edition. We are aware how important it is for the community to have an extensive set of high quality examples covering the various domains, languages, and research approaches. While highly praised, the examples available in TEI Publisher so far cover only a limited range of applications and represent only a small selection of what can be done.

E-editiones encourages everyone to propose examples which could serve as a model or blueprint for other users working on digital editions. If you have something in mind, please send a short proposal to the e-editiones board, briefly describing the source material you'd like to make available, major points of interest regarding the TEI encoding (or an encoded sample), as well as the features, techniques, or area of research you would like to demonstrate with it. If the board agrees on incorporating your example, you will receive **500 Swiss Francs** as compensation for your preparation effort, and we'll help you with technical questions you may have along the way.  !  Finished examples will include the source TEI under a license allowing redistribution, an ODD for display, and, where necessary, an HTML template. We in particular look for examples covering one or more of the following areas:  - The sample TEI material is from a domain or focuses on research topics not yet covered by TEI Publisher examples. - It demonstrates one or more particular features of the TEI Processing Model and TEI Publisher in a way other users can learn from. For example, ODD processing model rules, a special use of components in an HTML template, or well-designed, high quality print output. - It covers languages or scripts not currently represented in TEI Publisher, especially RTL or CJK languages. We would appreciate if this could be accompanied by a translation into one of the European languages to make the example easier to interpret for users unfamiliar with a particular script.  The first 5 proposals accepted will receive 500 Swiss Francs each upon delivery of the complete sample.

Today there are 12 institutional and 30 individual members. However, it remains our goal to attract new members who will continuously support the association.  One of e-editiones' strategic goals is to ensure the long-term availability of digital editions. To this end e-editiones supports hosting offers that also include the continuous maintenance of digital editions (software updates). This year Archives Online has set up such an offer with «Sources Online». Some of the editions associated with e-editiones already use the Sources Online servers.  In February 2021, e-editiones received a grant by the Ernst Göhner Stiftung. The joint proposal was backed by a number of members and their institutions. Together with the additional generous contributions made by participating projects, this grant supported a larger part of the development work past year.  With the Escher correspondence, a prominent Swiss edition has been migrated to TEI Publisher. This step has been necessary since maintenance and hosting with the previous setup became too expensive in the long term. With TEI Publisher application hosted by Sources Online, the annual costs are reduced to a third.

On Twitter, we post 4 to 5 tweets per month. 2021 brought us 172 new followers.  Our mailing list, on the other hand, is not very actively used. We are happy to receive suggestions and ideas on how to proceed with it.  !   TEI Publisher Developments  In February 2021 e-editiones successfully applied for a grant by the Ernst Göhner Stiftung, from which we received 30000 SFR for further TEI Publisher development. The joint proposal was backed by a number of members and their institutions and included features like:  - support for web annotations - versioning and long term availability - persistent URLs - accessibility - showing and navigating events in a timeline - display of mathematical formulas  Obviously the budget did not suffice to cover everything planned, but thanks to the additional contributions provided by the member institutions, we could address the main topics and even go beyond in some areas.   Web Annotations  The most visible feature is the editor for web-based annotations, released in version 7.1.0. The development team had been contemplating this feature already for a couple years and thanks to additional generous funding by the Office of the Historian at the US Department of State, it finally became reality. Being able to annotate TEI documents via a graphic, web based interface eases the burden of enhancing a transcription with semantic, analytic or text-critical markup. Users work in a user-friendly environment in which XML code is neatly hidden from sight. The integration of external authority databases saves a lot of time, improves consistency and opens possibilities for data exchange and interoperability. At the same time, the annotation editor is fully configurable, allowing complex, nested markup where necessary. Several member institutions are actively using the editor in their daily work and continue to contribute to its development.  The annotation editor marks the first milestone in our endeavour to extend TEI Publisher to support the entire editing workflow rather than just publishing the end result. Further steps are already in planning, e.g. form-based editing of the TEI header, which will offer the same level of customizability and extensibility.   Web Components  Several new web components have been released during the past year: most notable, a new timeline component allows users to visualise dates and events in an interactive, graphical display. The component can be used to directly select a date or date range, or it can be connected to a facetted search to drill down into a collection of items. Development was supported by the Staatsarchiv Zürich. This component is prominently featured in the remake of the Alfred Escher correspondence edition (to be announced soon).  The Bernoulli edition in Basel financed a component to display mathematical formulas embedded in the TEI text, using either MathML or TeX notation. Other new components include a grid element for viewing tabular data, and a \"split list\", which comes handy when browsing lists of places, people or abbreviations. The latter was again financed by the Staatsarchiv Zürich and first appeared in the Escher correspondence.  As usual, many other components have seen major improvements needed by concrete projects. For example, the map component is now able to display a large number of places at once by clustering the markers.   TEI Publisher 8  The next major release of TEI Publisher is currently being finalized. It will include a few breaking changes, mainly in the libraries used, but as usual we're aiming to remain as backwards compatible as possible. One reason for the breaking changes is to better support persistent, bookmarkable URLs as well as browsing the navigation history. The goal is to make the URL structure as seen by the end-user completely independent of the underlying organization of documents and collections. This involves both a server- and client-side part.  The main remaining task on the way to the release is to extensively document the possibilities and approaches enabled by those changes.   Other Software Packages  In line with our modular development policy, a number of software packages which should be considered part of Publisher 8 are published in separate repositories:  - tuttle - a Git Integration for eXist-db (stable): allows synchronizing a data collection directly from a github or gitlab repository to the database. It can deal with multiple repositories as well as incremental updates. Thanks to the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe for contributing funding. - TEI Publisher Named Entity Recognition API (beta): adds named entity recognition to the web-based annotation editor. Use it to identify places, people and other entities while annotating a document. The package also provides scripts to train your own model based on already annotated documents via machine learning. Training data is automatically extracted from the annotated document by TEI Publisher, so there's no need to go through the tedious task of compiling suitable data by hand. - Static Site Generator for TEI Publisher (beta): transform a website based on TEI Publisher into a static version, which no longer requires TEI Publisher nor eXist-db. The feature intends to provide a low cost option for small editions whose main purpose is to allow users to browse through a collection of texts without demanding sophisticated search or navigation facilities. Generated files can be easily hosted on free services like GitHub pages. To see it in action, visit our viewer for the TEI Guidelines, which we used as a testbed. - Docker Compose Configuration (beta): a configuration to help users install a TEI Publisher-based application on a docker-enabled host. It handles the more difficult tasks of installing a reverse proxy in front of Publisher as well as registering an SSL certificate. Hosting via docker compose can be a viable option for smaller projects with limited budget and users who lack the server administration skills necessary to set up a dedicated hosting service. - Fore: an XForms-inspired library for building complex forms with web components. While this is not an integral part of TEI Publisher yet, it will become the fundament for many of the future, workflow-related features we have in mind (see below).   The Future  The e-editiones board will prepare a new joint funding proposal soon. To be successfull we'll again need projects or institutions to express interest and signal readiness to make a contribution (in whatever way). If you are working with TEI Publisher and wish for a certain feature, please do not hesitate to contact us, so we can add it to the list of topics.  A main area we currently have in mind is to further enhance TEI Publisher with respect to supporting the editorial workflow:  - integrate general metadata - i.e. TEI header - editing facilities based on customizable forms - add an interface to manage local authorities within the annotation framework - support other annotation types, e.g. empty elements and stand-off annotations which are not inlined - named entitiy recognition: automatically connect detected entities with matching authority entries - allow batch processing of entire documents via named entity recognition - support multi-user workflows with support for a annotate/review/merge process  Other areas might be:  - a form-based interface to customize basic settings and CSS variables - direct integration with Transkribus and other HTR/OCR software - support for other input formats (Excel, CSV) - remove the dependency on Google Material Design to make all visual aspects configurable - port the core TEI processing model implementation to be usable without eXist (e.g. directly within oXygen) - drop the somewhat arbitrary distinction between browsing and searching currently imposed by publisher and refactor the search API to be more easily customizable - enhance and speed up search result display (KWIC)  If any of this rings a bell, please consider if you could support it by taking part in the joint funding proposal. Obviously we'll also be more than happy to pick up suggestions not yet on the list.

The idea is to further simplify the work of editors when annotating documents via TEI Publisher’s web-based annotation editor by automatically identifying potential candidates for people, places etc.  !  If you have the development branch (or future TEI Publisher 8) installed and the named entity recognition (NER) service running (more on this below), an additional button will be shown in the top left toolbar. Clicking on it gives you a choice of NER models to use. By default those are the standard models provided by the NER engine we're using. Below we see NER in action, detecting entities in a modern-language text copied from wikipedia.   !NER in action  Entities identified by NER get a marker in striped color, which allows users to distinguish them from annotations, which were manually tagged. The user can now review the identified entities, assign them an authority entry etc. As each annotation is reviewed, the stripes will be removed.  While NER works well in this case on a modern language text, you'll soon encounter the limits of the standard model when trying it out on different types of literature. However, we can gradually improve the quality of the entity recognition by feeding completely annotated documents back into the process, i.e. train our own recognition model. The ideal workflow could be imagined as follows:  - editors manually tag a portion of documents via web-based annotations - once a certain number of entities has been tagged, we can train a custom model - continuing the annotation process, the custom model can be used to identify potential candidates for semantic annotations, thus improving the workflow - the model is retrained on the growing set of fully annotated documents, resulting in better prediction rates  The ultimate goal is to make this process as smooth as possible, i.e. it should not hinder your editing work, but support it!  The integration in TEI Publisher is completely functional, but we need more testing, experimenting and kicking the tires with some real-world use cases. NLP is not a simple subject and I’m in no way an expert, so I’d like to invite the community to help. I have just prepared the ground work.   Technical Background  There are plenty of NLP and NER libraries and tools. However, such libraries work on plain text, not structured texts like TEI. They will get confused by angle brackets (just like many humans). The trick thus is to transform the XML into a plain text without loosing context, which means we somehow need to keep track of element boundaries, offsets of inline elements etc.  Likewise, the result of running NER is again a plain text document, accompanied by a list of detected entities and character offsets. Those need to be mapped back onto the XML structure and eventually merged into the TEI. This back-and-forth conversion is the main job handled by TEI Publisher and its API.  My first idea was to integrate another, existing command-line tool for enriching TEI with named entities. But after a few first experiments, it occurred to me that TEI Publisher already had some important bits and pieces in place within the annotation framework:  - it defines a standoff JSON format to keep annotations separate from the TEI as long as the user is making changes. The web-based editor reads this format to display the nice fruit salad - i.e. marked entities - you see on screen. - it implements algorithms to merge the standoff annotations into inline TEI elements. This works loss-less: anything which is not an annotation is left untouched. The merge algorithm is fast and reliable.  We could thus reuse those building blocks and just add a communication layer, which mediates between TEI Publisher and the external NLP library. This communication layer has been realized through a set of Open API endpoints on both sides, allowing them to have a conversation, sending data back and forth. Below you see the NLP API endpoints exposed by TEI Publisher:  !  The NLP part is a python service using spaCy as the underlying NLP library. Compared to many NLP libraries I have seen before, spaCy has a rather simple, clean API. Getting started proved to be smooth and painless as most of the functionality comes pre-configured and ready to be used. A Python notebook demonstrating how to do a simple NER with spaCy is shown below:  !  SpaCy can do more than just NER, e.g. part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, sentence segmentation, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis. It is also quite extensible, allowing other libraries to be plugged into its pipelines.   Training a model  Whenever you use a general-purpose NER model, you’ll quickly notice that it works great for some types of texts, i.e. texts similar to the ones it was trained on. However, results quickly degrade if you apply it to other genres or texts written in a slightly different period of time. For example, the German standard model in spaCy produces good results when run on a text from Wikipedia, but it already starts missing things when you apply it to letters written in the first half of the 20th century: the language used back then was just different, some would say: more sophisticated, than the language used today.  For example, if we run the standard German model against a letter by theologian Karl Barth written in 1921, many words are wrongly identified as places:  !  For most real world scenarios, there’s thus no way around training your own custom model. Fortunately this fits rather well into the annotation workflow implemented by TEI Publisher: usually, training a model involves going through a large amount of text to tell the NLP engine which words are considered part of an entity and which are not. Sometimes this is done in tabular form - which is quite tedious, but there are also tools to support the task, e.g. Prodigy, a commercial application created by the makers of spaCy.  All those approaches have one disadvantage: you do all the hard work just for the purpose of training a model. Compared to this, enriching the TEI with entities is a useful task in itself. Even if you figure out later that you can’t really use NER, the work invested is not lost. TEI Publisher tries to make this as seamless as possible, being able to transform any semantically rich TEI into training data. Preparing training data is thus kind of a natural side effect of annotating documents and does not require additional manual steps or separate tagging.  TEI Publisher exposes an API endpoint through which you can download training data in JSON format for either a single document or a whole collection.  It chunks the text into blocks (paragraphs, headings etc.) and extracts a plain text representation of each. Here it is important that sentences are preserved semantically. Inline notes, apps or choices would appear out of context in the middle of a sentence, so they have to be removed. Notes will be moved into separate blocks at the end.  All existing entities in a block, i.e. persName, placeName etc., are listed along with the text, recording their type, start and end positions:    This will contact a TEI Publisher generated app called `hsg-annotate`and retrieve training data from the `frus1981-88v05` collection below the app's data root, using English as the training language. The output of the command will pretty much look the same as the output you saw on the web before.   Conclusion  Even in its current, rudimentary form, the NER integration in TEI Publisher can already help to speed up the editing workflow. We do need to gain more experience with training custom models though and the community is warmly invited to help with this.  There’s also a lot of room for improving the annotation workflow, e.g. with  - automatically linking detected entities to authority entries (where non-ambiguous) - implement a wizard-like dialog, which walks users through the entities identified by NER one by one, allowing them to quickly confirm or reject an annotation and associate it with the correct authority entry - employ rule-based detection models in addition to the statistical, trained models: for example, if you already have a list of names from a back of book index, a rule-based algorithm may produce better results than a trained model - support batch operation across multiple documents - integrate other spaCy features like part-of-speech tagging etc. ","tags":["announcements","tei-publisher","tutorial","intermediate","NLP","NER"]},{"id":"/posts/shaping-the-future/","title":"Shaping the future","content":" In this months meetup we’ll talk about ongoing and planned developments in TEI Publisher.

Open source projects like TEI Publisher depend on an active, contributing community. Many believe that you need to be a programmer to contribute, but this is a misconception! Documentation, communication, supporting users or providing feedback are at least as important for an open source project as thousands of lines of code.  This session targets non-programmers as well as those with some development skills. We'll start with simple things, e.g. contributing to the FAQ, and then move on and show you how to create your own little web component to plug into TEI Publisher. We'll use a grid component for displaying tabular data as an example.   2021-06-15: For(e) humanists - Metadata, Forms and more  Joern Turner, eXistSolutions and Jinntec GmbH  Fore is a model-driven forms framework that follows the ideas of the XForms 2.0 Standard but translates those into the world of HTML5 Web Components.

Choose the `Create new file` option to write your text.  !Add file button{height=64px}  Unless you are a member of the editorial team, GitHub will warn you that you are about to make changes to a project you don't have write access to. This is ok! Your changes will result in a *pull request*, which will be sent to the e-editiones team for approval.  !GitHub editor view   Editing the article  As mentioned above, every article should start with a short header containing some basic metadata delimited by 3 dashes (`---`):    You should at least provide the full title, author, date and some tags. You may also supply a short title if your main title is longer than ~5 words. The *short title* as well as the *lead* will be used in post listings (like the one on the start page).

Images  You cannot upload images to the correct folder via the web interface, but you can drag and drop image files into the text editor and GitHub will generate a link. When reviewing the text, the editorial team will move the images into the correct place.   Submitting  Once you are happy with your article, fill out the form at the bottom of the GitHub page, titled *Propose new file*. Provide a title and maybe a short comment for the editorial team.  !Form to propose new file  After clicking *Propose new file*, you will be presented with another form for creating a so-called *pull request*.

This is where static site generators provide a perfect alternative to a dynamic, database-driven architecture like TEI Publisher. In this article we'll learn how to combine the best of both worlds.   Benefits of a static site  A static website is generated once during build time and does not change afterwards. All content is prepared in advance and the output is essentially just a set of files. The only job left for a server is to respond to requests by returning the prepared content. It does not need to process anything. This has a number of advantages:  * the site will be as fast as it can possibly be * hosting is cheap: you can mostly get it for free * you'll get an entirely self-sufficient, frozen snapshot of your content: ideal for archiving purposes * static content is perfect for mobile applications, which should continue to work when offline  For sure there are also some downsides: since everything is pre-generated, you have to know in advance what users might request. Dynamic functions like search are thus necessarily limited.  In the context of digital editions, there are nevertheless many use cases where a static site might be a viable option:  * the edition is rather small, i.e. concentrates on a single or a small collection of works * users are more interested in reading and browsing than complex searches * only a part of the site displays content generated from XML, while the rest remains static * you want to ensure that the content can stay online for a long time with no or low maintenance  The last point is addressing a problem we all face sooner or later: we created a fancy, TEI Publisher-powered website, but then the funding period ends and the university library tells us: sorry, we can only archive static content, not applications requiring a database. So having a – maybe slightly stripped down – static snapshot will at least allow potential users to dig up your site and look at it long after you switched jobs or retired.   Integrating TEI  A number of frameworks are available to help you create a static website. The e-editiones homepage is an example for this approach: it is based on a static website generator called 11ty. Articles are written using markdown syntax and the generator takes care to transform each article and wrap it into the site's HTML templates. It works great and – thanks to github – the hosting is free.  Digital editions are rarely based on markdown though. Can we integrate TEI or other XML content as well? Some might say: we can always write an XSLT to generate HTML and add this to our static site. But this means we'd loose most of the nice features a system like TEI Publisher provides and have to reimplement them. Is there an easier way?  At this point you may want to browse to a (currently) hidden page on the e-editiones website. What we see there is a static version of the latest TEI Publisher documentation! And we all know that the documentation is written in Docbook XML. So how did it get there? The mystery will be revealed in a minute...  !TEI Publisher documentation in e-editiones  If you investigate the source code for this page, you'll notice that it appears to be more or less like any HTML template in TEI Publisher (apart from the fact that it uses a different templating system to pull in the e-editiones header, menu etc.). We see all the familiar webcomponents like `<pb-document>`, `<pb-navigation>` etc. The main `<pb-view>` which displays the body of the content reads as follows:    Again we can later use this information in our HTML templates, e.g. to generate one page for each document using the same `dta` template.   Outlook  We successfully tested the 11ty plugin in various context. The TEI guidelines app demonstrates how you can create a static snapshot of a complete publisher-generated app. It worked so well that we will likely drop the dynamic app and continue further development on the static version only. Mid-term, the goal is to generate the entire TEI guidelines documentation on the command line without requiring a full TEI Publisher installation.  To some extent this is already possible as demonstrated by the automatic build, which is triggered whenever one pushes to the repository: it will start TEI Publisher as a docker image, launch 11ty to generate the static content and publish it.  It would be even better if we could skip the docker step. As discussed during the last TEI conference, we're already working to refactor the core library powering all transformations in TEI Publisher, i.e. tei-publisher-lib, to run with other XQuery engines, which would include e.g. saxon on the command line, thus dropping the need for an eXist-db/TEI Publisher installation.","tags":["feature","tei-publisher","tutorial","advanced"]},{"id":"/posts/planning-2023-community-events/","title":"Community Meetings in 2023","content":" !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@planetvolumes?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Planet Volumes</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/2023?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>  Dear community, the e-editiones board is currently planning 2023 and our community meetings.

This feature supplements the existing FO and LaTeX output modes. While FO and LaTeX require quite some customization in the ODD, Print CSS extends the existing HTML view and CSS styles to layout the text on the printed page.  Though it has improved, browser support for CSS Paged Media (often also called *Print CSS*) is still insufficient. However, there are tools to fill the gap. The starting point for my recent exploration into this technology was an edition of medieval hagiography. The editors requested a printout, which should ideally resemble the future website as closely as possible, so corrections could be done on paper. While LaTeX does provide all the fancy features needed (e.g. an aligned parallel layout of transcription and translation using the powerful reledpar package), the result would quickly diverge from the web version, hence would not be suitable for the review process.  Looking into CSS Paged Media as an alternative, I was surprised by what is possible by now in the browser. The book had quite a complex layout, using different types of marginal notes, text critical apparatus etc. Even though I could not realize every feature just within the browser and had to switch to an external utility (see below), the results were satisfactory and would certainly be sufficient for a slightly simpler edition.   A print preview for TEI Publisher  <figure class=\"right-margin\">     <img src=\"/img/serafin-print.png\">     <figcaption>Page from the TP demo with margin notes and running head rendered with paged.js</figcaption> </figure>  We have therefore decided to integrate this approach more tightly into TEI Publisher, providing a separate print preview page for those sample documents for which it makes sense, as well as an API endpoint to retrieve the complete HTML of a document targeted at print.  The new feature will become available with the TEI Publisher 8 release. If you would like to experiment with it right now, feel free to use one of the docker images - which always reflect the current state of development - or build TEI Publisher yourself.  The new print preview page includes a brilliant javascript library, paged.js, which fills many of the gaps in browsers concerning CSS Print support. Without this library, web browsers would ignore most parts of the page layout and just generate a very basic printout. With paged.js though, you can use the browser's default print dialog to get a pretty fancy printed version.  paged.js is open source and still under development, so there are limitations (see below). For linear documents like the TEI Publisher documentation it does produce very good results though.    New print output mode in tei-publisher-lib  Obviously not everything you can do on a screen will work on paper. For example, the `alternate` behaviour defined in the TEI guidelines will by default generate a popup if you use the `web` output mode in TEI Publisher. We can't do that on paper. Therefore we need a way to distinguish between HTML targeted at the screen and HTML for print by using a different output mode in the ODD. This requires a change in the underlying core library of TEI Publisher, called `tei-publisher-lib`.   The newly released `tei-publisher-lib` version 3.0.0 reassigns the `print` output mode to generate HTML for print. `print` extends `web`, overwriting the two behaviours, which would fail on paper: `note` and `alternate`. Both involve popups. `print` just outputs them as plain HTML to be processed by print CSS styles.  You'll need to update `tei-publisher-lib` to benefit from the newly added features. `print` was previously defined as a synonym for `fo` and generated XML output to be further processed by an XSL/FO engine like Apache fop. Reassigning it constitutes a breaking change (hence the major 3.0.0 version, which indicates: not backwards compatible), though the `fo` mode will still work as before. Please keep this in mind when you decide to upgrade and read the instructions.   Adding CSS for print  TEI Publisher 8 will include a default CSS stylesheet for print, residing in `resources/css/print.css`. The API endpoint, which generates HTML for print, automatically injects this. The default stylesheet sets the paper size to 'A4', adds margins for recto and verso pages, page numbers in the respective bottom corners, and most important: a footnote area at the bottom. HTML elements with class *footnote* will be output there.  You can extend this by adding your own print styles as follows: if you have not done that yet, create an empty CSS file next to the location in which your ODD is stored (`odd` in TEI Publisher or `resources/odd` in a generated app). Associate this with your ODD by adding a corresponding `<rendition>` element to the `<teiHeader>`:     Limitations and alternatives  <figure class=\"right-margin\">     <img src=\"/img/serafin-prince.png\">     <figcaption>Parallel display of transcription and translation rendered via Prince XML</figcaption> </figure>  The *paged.js* library is still under development and has its limitations. For example, I have not been able to create a two column layout with aligned transcription and translation, though I tried various approaches. Using a table worked as long as both parallel paragraphs would fit on the page, but longer paragraphs were separated.  Fortunately there are several tools which run outside the browser and provide better coverage for Print CSS, though the majority of them is commercial. A list can be found on print-css.rocks.  <figure class=\"left\">     <img src=\"/img/print-preview-copy.png\" height=\"196px\">     <figcaption>Toolbar</figcaption> </figure>  Most of those tools operate on the command line and expect an HTML file as input. To simplify this task we created an API endpoint in TEI Publisher, which retrieves the print optimized HTML for an entire document and injects the necessary stylesheets. You can copy the endpoint URL for a given document by using the corresponding button in the print preview interface.   For example, using Prince XML on windows, one can paste this URL directly into the application's dialog. The endpoint URL has the following structure:  `/api/document/test%2Forlik_to_serafin.xml/print?odd=serafin.odd &base=%2Fexist%2Fapps%2Ftei-publisher%2Ftest%2F &style=resources%2Ffonts%2Ffont.css &style=resources%2Fcss%2Fprint.css`  Here `odd` defines the ODD to use for the transformation, `base` is the base URI from which additional stylesheets or images are loaded, and `style` lists one or more additional CSS stylesheets.   Conclusion  While I have many years of experience with FO and worked on some LaTeX-based projects, I did not really look into Paged Media CSS until recently. Though browser support is still lacking, a library like paged.js definitely fills the gap, at least for documents not requiring parallel layout or huge tables (see the TEI Publisher documentation for example). For complex layouts, commercial software like Antennahouse or PrinceXML (to just name two) can provide high quality print.  <figure>     <img src=\"/img/tei-publisher-docs-printcss.png\">     <figcaption>Two pages from the TEI Publisher documentation rendered with paged.js</figcaption> </figure>  The one great advantage of using Print CSS instead of FO or LaTeX is that you can work on the web and the print version at the same time and generate both from the same ODD, distinguishing the output mode in a few places only. This allows for rapid prototyping and quick review cycles.   We'd like to ask the community to support us in this area by contributing further examples. Help us push the limits of what can be done.","tags":["announcements","tei-publisher"]},{"id":"/posts/tei-publisher-lib-3/","title":"tei-publisher-lib 3: Print CSS and other new features","content":"   > Version 3.0.0 features a dedicated output mode to better support printing HTML using paged media CSS, and two small extensions to the TEI Processing Model.  `tei-publisher-lib` contains the code libraries used for ODD processing and the different supported output modes.

See <a href=\"preventing-unwanted-updates\">below how to prevent this</a>.</p> </div>   A dedicated output mode for Print CSS  TEI Publisher 8 will feature a simpler approach for creating print output using the Print CSS and CSS Paged Media standards. This supplements the existing FO and LaTeX output modes. The new features will be covered in a separate article.   With respect to `tei-publisher-lib`, one major change was introduced: the `print` output mode, which was previously a synonym for `fo`, now targets HTML optimized for print.   Extensions to the Processing Model  We added two carefully chosen features to our implementation of the TEI Processing Model, which have been extensively tested, but not announced or documented until now:  1. a method to specify a *processing mode* passed to all subsequently called models 2. a way to set a parameter, so it will become available to models processed below  The first is implemented as a specialization of the second. Both features are not intended for daily use, but rather for edge cases, where the standard mechanisms for handling the flow of processing are not enough. This mainly applies to cases in which you have to process the same parts of the TEI document multiple times in different contexts. None of the examples shipping with TEI Publisher needs those features, but in complex ODDs we frequently encounter situations which cannot be handled without those extensions.   Processing Modes  Distinguishing between processing modes is a common feature in XSLT. It comes handy if you need to process the same XML more than once for different purposes. One common example would be to generate a separate index page: the elements you want to process are likely the same as when you output the body of the document, but you need to render them differently. While you can often use tricks to somehow distinguish the two cases, it's sometimes simply not possible.  tei-publisher-lib 3 allows you to specify a new extension attribute, `@pb:mode`, on a `<model>`. The value of the attribute will be taken as the name of the mode, and subsequently called models can check it via a variable, e.g. `$mode=\"bibliography\"`. This allows you to distinguish different modes in a predicate.   Setting Parameters  Older versions already supported parameters to be passed into the ODD. However, those parameters came from external sources and there was no way to set a parameter from within a model in the ODD. Sometimes you may wish to do so, for example, to compile a sorted list of people, whose details are not given in the document itself, but an auxilary authority file, which you have to pull in before sorting. Again, using tricks often helps in such a task, but not always.  tei-publisher-lib now supports setting a parameter, so it becomes available to subsequent models. The syntax is the same as for the standard `<param name=\"foo\" value=\"baz\"/>`. Just the name of the element changes to `<pb:set-param>`, marking this as an extension.   Upgrading  The 3.0.0 release of `tei-publisher-lib` constitutes a breaking change, so please be aware that you will have to adjust your TEI Publisher-generated custom application after upgrading.  In previous versions, the output mode `print` was a synonym for `fo`. It generated XML output to be further processed by an XSL/FO engine like Apache fop. This has changed: `print` now refers to the Print CSS mode, which extends the `web` output mode.    If you have been generating output targetted at XSL/FO, make sure to use the `fo` output mode instead of `print`, but we strongly recommend waiting for the 8.0 release of TEI Publisher and do a full upgrade in this case.  If you have not been using XSL/FO, you may upgrade `tei-publisher-lib` right now, following some extra steps:  TEI Publisher compiles ODDs into XQuery code. Loading this generated code will fail after you upgraded to `tei-publisher-lib` 3 as the imports used in your custom app will be wrong.  To fix this, follow the steps below. You can either apply them to a custom application already installed in eXist, or make the code changes on disk and (re-)install the custom application. Doing the latter, you can skip steps 3 and 4 as those will be performed automatically during the install process.    1. Check `resources/odd/configuration.xml`  If you registered any custom XQuery module in your `resources/odd/configuration.xml` for the `web` output mode, make sure to also enable this for the `print` output mode by copying the corresponding configuration section:    This means that only version updates starting with a 2 should be applied.","tags":["announcements","tei-publisher","tei-publisher-lib","release"]},{"id":"/print-css/","title":"Generating CSS for print","content":" > TEI Publisher 8 will support creating print output using CSS Paged Media.

Browser history, bookmarkable URLs  The newest release of TEI Publisher involved major redesigns in the libraries used. Perhaps the biggest change – though not immediately visible – took place in web components: from the start we tried to create each component as independent, monadic entity, communicating with other components only through signals. This results in great flexibility as you can recombine and reuse components all over the place, but it also turns pages into a beehive, without a central coordination center. This is in particular problematic when we look at the navigation aspect: to put it simply, users expect that  1. bookmarking a page and reloading it later will result in the same display 2. using the browser history back and forth navigation properly restores previous state  Previously each component would handle its own state, sometimes reacting to parameters and browser history events, sometimes not. The new 2.x.x series of components introduces a central state management, which each component uses as single source of information about the current state. Combined with the  flexibility of server-side URL handling via the Open API, this solution gives us more informative and bookmarkable URLs.   <div class=\"alert alert-warning\"> <p>Please note that we follow a semantic versioning scheme: an increase in the major version number indicates a breaking c﻿hange, i.e. not backwards compatible version. While majority of web components will work as before, some may need special attention (in particular <code>pb-facs-link</code> in combination with <code>pb-facsimile</code>, see <a href=\"compatibility-and-upgrading\">below</a>).</p> </div>   Paged Media CSS  Breaking changes also occurred in TEI Publisher's core library, `tei-publisher-lib`. The main reason being the added support for Print CSS as a new output mode. Print CSS – officially called *Paged Media CSS* – represents an option to generate good looking printouts using just HTML and CSS. While browser support is still incomplete, there are tools to fill the gap, making it possible to produce high-quality print output. TEI Publisher 8 provides out-of-the-box interfaces for these tools. Details have already been covered in a community meetup, so please refer to the e-editiones blog for detailed information.  <figure>     <img src=\"/img/tei-publisher-docs-printcss.png\">     <figcaption>Two pages from the TEI Publisher documentation rendered with paged.js</figcaption> </figure>  `tei-publisher-lib` 3.0.0 also introduces two new extensions to the processing model, namely *processing modes* and *parameter setting*. Read more about this in the separate announcement.   Named entity recognition  Thanks to another new library we created, TEI Publisher's web annotation editor now also includes experimental support for *detecting and tagging named entities in texts*. Even better, training your own model is tightly integrated with TEI Publisher: it will directly generate training data from already annotated TEI texts.  !NER in action  Please note that this feature requires an external service. If you would like to give it a try, please consult the corresponding article.   Redesigned start page  The TEI Publisher application itself shows a bunch of new examples and a redesigned start page, which blurs the boundary between browsing and search. The HTML behind the page got more modular, allowing editions to better mix and match features in the way which best fits the material presented.  !New start page with integrated search   JATS as first class citizen  Finally, JATS (the Journal Publishing Tag Library) joins TEI and Docbook as a fully supported XML format. This means you may not only view JATS documents, but also browse and search them.   Compatibility and Upgrading  Due to the breaking changes in associated libraries, updating a custom edition generated with TEI Publisher 7 to 8 requires several manual steps. While the list may look rather long, they are not very complex and can be applied quickly if you follow the instructions.  Other particular changes to pay attention to:  * The behaviour of the `pb-facsimile` and `pb-facs-link` webcomponents has changed: `pb-facs-link` must now emit to the event channel `pb-facsimile` is listening to. Previously emitting to the default channel was enough. You should thus change all `pb-facs-link` elements generated by your ODD to include an `@emit` attribute targetting the correct channel. * `tei-publisher-lib` 3.x.x reassigns the `print` output mode to generate HTML output targeted at print. In older version `print` was defined as an alias for `fo`. You may therefore have to change your ODDs if you used the fo mode. A more elaborate explanation of the changes is presented in this e-editiones article.","tags":["announcements","tei-publisher","release"]},{"id":"/posts/building-a-political-txt-edition-with-tei-publisher/","title":"Building a political text editition with TEI Publisher.

The goal was to convert the publication model to XML as quickly, cost-effectively as possible (during the ongoing editorial work), and  also to get  the edition website running quickly and similar to the old website (which was based on PDF/DSpace). Particular focus was placed on identifying and tagging of all persons mentioned in the protocols and linking the entries with authority files like the GND, therefor searchable registers (at the moment Person, Literature) and a calendar view. Right now, the edition contains almost 5700 meeting minutes and a database with almost 11.000 Persons.

The project’s realisation included a simple transcription of the diaries and the semantic annotation of persons, concepts and literary references found in the text, using the virtual research environment Geovistory. The latter allows research data in the historical sciences, and more broadly in the humanities and beyond, to be produced in the form of a collaborative knowledge graph. A TEI-Publisher edition was then built, converting the transcription into an XML/TEI database, annotated with URIs from the Geovistory RDF data repository, dereferenced and persistent. From this prototype, the speakers wish to share experiences and questions with the e-editiones community on these issues:  - Best practices for semantic encoding in different communities - Online XML/TEI editors (web-components) capable of providing widgets for semantic encoding of texts using RDF information sources - Guidelines to enable a minimum level of encoding and semantic annotation to enable automated data collection and re-use in the spirit of open research data - Community building to sustain and develop a long-term research infrastructure dedicated to semantically enriched text transcriptions and critical editions.","tags":["events","meetups"]},{"id":"/posts/community-event-fischer/","title":"Travel by mouse click: the digital edition of the travel journals of Johann Conrad Fischer 1794–1851","content":" Upcoming community meetup on June 13, 2023  For Fischer's 250th birthday in 2023, the Iron Library is realising a digital edition of his travel journals and is also translating the texts from the original German into English for the first time.

The goal was to develop an experimental alternative to the traditional back-of-book indexing process by using TEI Publisher's annotation tool to select indexable entities in documents according to categories such as places, people, events, topics, and agreements/mandates. In this project, TEI Publisher draws on a collaborative, relational database system called Airtable, which gathers potential entries across multiple FRUS volumes and projects, to create browsable facets through which users can better understand the documents. The same annotations can also be used to create index entries and automatically generate an index for the volume.  <iframe width=\"1117\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v77DMPO-Pv4\" title=\"How History At State uses TEI Publisher&39;s annotation tool and Airtable\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  - Recording: Youtube   ","tags":["events","meetups"]},{"id":"/posts/tei-publisher-lib-4/","title":"tei-publisher-lib 4: Refactoring TEI output mode","content":"   > Version 4.0.0 refactors the TEI output mode, making it more widely usable for transformation scenarios producing TEI  `tei-publisher-lib` contains the code libraries used for ODD processing and the different supported output modes. It implements the TEI Processing Model as defined by the TEI guidelines.  <div class=\"alert alert-warning\">     <p>We use semantic versioning for all TEI Publisher projects: a change in the first digit of the version number indicates a <strong>breaking change</strong>. You should be aware that such releases are not fully backwards compatible and may require adjustments to existing apps.</p>     <p><strong>Warning</strong>: custom applications generated by TEI Publisher may update `tei-publisher-lib` automatically when (re-)installed into eXist. See <a href=\"../tei-publisher-lib-3preventing-unwanted-updates\">how to prevent this</a>.</p> </div>  The TEI Processing Model is not only useful for transforming TEI into some other XML output format, but it can also produce TEI from something else. For example, the MS Word import in TEI Publisher converts files in the docx format to TEI with the help of an ODD and the `tei` output mode.  Recently we encountered another case which could be elegantly solved with an ODD: the task was to clean up TEI produced by a form-based editor, eliminating superfluous attributes and element hierarchies. So the input as well as the output of the transformation were TEI. Unfortunately the implementation of the tei output mode included some solutions which were specific to the processing of docx documents – and consequently those  were unnecessarily applied. We therefore had to refactor the library, cleanly separating the docx-specific processing from the general tei output mode.  We also added a new behaviour, `copy`, to the mode, which will copy the current element's start/end tag and attributes before recursively processing its contents. This is useful, as the default behaviour of the TEI PM is to skip any tags it does not know how to handle.   Other changes  Another new feature which was already released in 3.1.0 – but not documented: you can now access variables and functions defined in the global configuration XQuery module (`config.xqm`) within your ODD. Configuration variables and functions are exposed to XPath expressions in the ODD under the prefix `global`. So to access the current data root collection, you can simply write `$global:data-root` to refer to the corresponding variable defined in `config.xqm`.   Upgrading  As indicated by the incremented major version number (4.0.0), this release is not backwards compatible. Importing Word docx documents will stop working! Other functionality should not be affected though.  To fix this issue after upgrading a custom application you built, you need to add an extra import to `resources/odd/configuration.xml`:    The upcoming version 8.1 of TEI Publisher will already include the required changes.","tags":["announcements","tei-publisher","tei-publisher-lib","release"]},{"id":"/posts/community-event-publisher9/","title":"Dive into TEI Publisher 9","content":" Upcoming community meetup on February 6, 2024  Let's celebrate the new edition of TEI Publisher, version 9. We'll give you a guided tour around some of the new features, including creating and consuming IIIF manifests, the redesigned annotation editor, register data entry, improved facet selection etc. This will be a hands-on session, showing how to configure, customize and extend those new goodies.","tags":["events","meetups"]},{"id":"/posts/tei-publisher-9/","title":"TEI Publisher 9.0.0","content":"> Version 9 has seen a major rework of the annotation facilities and introduces local authority registers for people, places and organizations. There have been small but powerful improvements to facets, extensions to client-side URL routing, numerous minor fixes and – last but not least – added support for IIIF manifests.  !Redesigned annotation editor with local register   IIIF manifests  As showcased in the Shakespeare sample and app, TEI Publisher now supports generating IIIF presentation manifests and displaying them alongside the text. A presentation manifest combines a set of images together with metadata, so instead of displaying single facsimiles via the IIIF image service, we have a standardized description of all the images associated with a resource. While there are external tools for creating IIIF manifests, we can easily auto-generate them from the TEI header and page beginnings as long as those have `@facs` attributes from which the image service links can be determined. This is demonstrated in the Shakespeare sample but should work with any other TEI meeting the requirements.  !IIIF presentation manifest viewer  The manifest viewer provided by TEI Publisher components is based on the excellent tify project and is integrated into Publisher's chain of events. This way, text and image view communicate to each other, which means that if you navigate to the next page/image in either of the two, the other reacts accordingly.   Client-side URL routing  The URL routing features introduced with version 8 have been substantially improved, introducing configurable URL templates also on the client side. This means you can construct URLs which are really completely independent of the underlying data organisation, while making sure the user always sees the page in a consistent state. Previously you still needed to have the path to the document somewhere in the URL. This is no longer required. For example, the documentation app now uses an URL of the form `/documentation/{chapter-id}`. And if you look at one of the projects realized with TEI Publisher recently, the travel diaries of Johann Conrad Fischer, you'll see that the page URLs consists of `/{language}/{year-of-diary}/{chapter-number}`. To make this possible, we have to make sure server and client are \"on the same page\" all the time.   Base ODD refactoring  This version also brings the demise of the `teiSimplePrint` ODD, previously the source ODD from which  `teipublisher` ODD inherits. Models from SimplePrint, after thorough review, have been merged into the default TEI Publisher ODD. This is a first step on the road for the extended and rationalized base ODD, a project inspired by the TEI Vanilla meetups of yore and now undertaken by e-editiones in cooperation with the TEI consortium.   Redesigned annotation editor  The new annotation editor boasts a new, more user friendly and ergonomic layout with additional capacity to add or edit registry entries from within the editor. Furthermore, a function to find potential matches in other documents for the current annotation and review them on the spot is a long awaited feature, which promises to speed up the editing process without compromising quality or consistency.  !Search and review occurrences of entity in other documents  A default set up for local registers of places, people and organizations allows editors to curate these resources under the same roof and at the same time as they annotate the sources. Local registers can extend the configured external authority: editors can either add information to an entity copied from the external authority, or provide information about entities not described elsewhere.  A number of default input forms is provided for people, organizations and places. They are based on a forms framework called fore, which takes the best parts from the former XForms standard to plain HTML. This means you can modify and extend the provided forms in a purely declarative manner. All you need to do is to change the TEI/XML templates and add controls to the HTML.  !Edit a place entity   Selecting facets  !{.right width=220 style=margin-left:1rem}  Now it became easier to select less frequent facets when browsing or searching: previously only the most frequent facets were shown by default and you had to browse through a potentially long list if you wanted to find a not so common one. Now you can easily configure the facets to display a combo box in addition to the list, allowing users to type in a query and see all the matching facets.

"},{"id":"/posts/edep/","title":"EDEp – Editing Tools for Digital Epigraphy","content":" The EDEp project, funded by the DFG from 2022 to 2024, researches the possibilities and demands of digital epigraphy and develops corresponding editing tools. Rather than aiming at yet another project-specific solution, the goal was to create a versatile toolbox, designed for customizability and extensibility.  In a nutshell, EDEp adds a convenient editor for epigraphic material encoded in EpiDoc to TEI Publisher. But it’s more than that: it’s a collection of tools and technologies, which can be used to support editors in creating any kind of metadata in TEI. In this respect it is following TEI Publisher’s concept of providing a box of modular “Lego” blocks rather than a monolithic one-size-fits-all framework. The EDEp toolbox includes  * a declarative forms framework in modern HTML, which operates directly on the actual TEI XML: no data mapping or conversion required * web components for transcribing inscriptions using Leiden markup * components allowing assisted XML editing of specific micro-environments  The project demonstrates how these components can be assembled to support a complex editing workflow. Combined with TEI Publisher’s ODD-based transformations for the presentation part, these features mark another important step forward towards a complete edition creation workflow within a single application.   EpiDoc  As a customization of TEI, EpiDoc is not a rigid standard in the sense that there’s only one way to encode things. Epigraphic projects cover a wide range of fields and will necessarily differ in the details to be encoded. Furthermore, EpiDoc documents feature a mix of structured and unstructured data, posing challenges for conventional data modeling, such as that required by relational databases.  EDEp operates directly on the EpiDoc TEI, therefore avoiding the need to establish and maintain a data mapping between user input, database and the resulting XML. Adding a feature then simply becomes a matter of extending the EpiDoc XML template and binding a form control to the new nodes to allow editing. For sure this still requires certain skills and a good understanding of the EpiDocTEI, basic HTML and XPath, but no actual programming.   The Application  To see the EDEp application in action, log in as user “edep” with password “edep”. To get to the editor, click on the pencil icon below the document title. Full instructions concerning installation and customization are available on GitHub.  !Start page  The current state of the application itself should be considered an early beta, i.e. fully usable, but still under development. For sure the visual aspects of the form could be improved, but our focus so far was on functionality, not design, and most of the development time went into preparing the foundations upon which others can hopefully build in the future.   The Forms All forms were authored in a declarative way: they are just modern HTML – no script coding, building or bundling required. As a result, modifying or extending the forms to fit your own requirements can be done without programming. And, most important: all form controls operate directly on the real EpiDoc TEI loaded into the browser in the background! No need to define a complex data mapping: each form field targets the XML it binds to via an XPath expression. As you edit any of the fields, the EpiDoc TEI is constantly updated within the browser’s memory to reflect the changes and can be saved on request.  !EDEp editor  The forms framework, Fore, was developed independently by Jinntec, but EDEp served as the most complex test case so far and required the development team to address various technical and conceptual issues. Also thanks to EDEp, Fore has advanced into a production ready tool.  To give you a quick impression, a form field in the HTML of the editor will look like this (in slightly simplified form):    As you can see, this wraps a standard HTML `select` with a `label` into an `fx-control`. Elements starting with `fx-` are custom web components, which come with Fore. All modern web browsers know how to deal with these web components as the technology has been part of the HTML5 standard for a while now.  !The preservation field as shown on the screen  The `fx-control` connects the form controls with the underlying EpiDoc document. The `@ref` attribute binds the control to the `condition` element in the `teiHeader` via the given XPath expression (relative to the elements selected by parent controls). Whenever the user changes the preservation field, the `condition` element in the `teiHeader` will change accordingly.   The Transcription While the transcription is stored as TEI/XML within the EpiDoc, epigraphers would normally use the *Leiden convention* for encoding it. Leiden provides a fast way to capture details, which would otherwise require rather verbose TEI markup. Drawing some inspiration (and code) from the Patrimonium project, we decided to implement an editor component, which allows users to switch between Leiden and TEI, converting on the fly between the two. The typical workflow would be to first transcribe using Leiden and then – if needed – fine tune the XML with additional information not supported by Leiden, e.g. references to places or people.  Leiden comes in different variants. While the editor also supports EDH and Petrae, we suggest *Leiden+* as the preferred syntax. The main reasons: it allows grammar-based validation, error reporting and a clean roundtrip from Leiden+ to XML and back.  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bcr0a-obD8I?si=QLF55FoOB5NuG2AR\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  The video above shows the transcription using Leiden on top and the generated TEI at the bottom. The editor detects incorrect Leiden+ and provides some utilities to correct e.g. the line numbering. Editing the Leiden+ will immediately change the TEI, but as soon as the user edits the XML, the Leiden+ editor is hidden to indicate that the XML is considered the canonical version. One can reopen the Leiden+ editor as long as the XML stays compatible with Leiden+.  The editor is fully customizable with code snippets, toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts.   Inline Markup: XML Editors  When encoding the translation, commentary or apparatus, users would obviously like to include rich markup, e.g. for bibliographic references, semantic annotations etc., so a plain text editor would not be sufficient. In fact, users quickly expressed the wish to be able to use inline markup for basically all free text inputs.  EDEp therefore adds a powerful XML editing component, providing a micro-environment for specific subparts of the EpiDoc. The editor features context-sensitive suggestions: if a user edits, for example, a note attached to a bibliographic entry, the editor “knows” the tags which may appear in this exact context and displays corresponding suggestions when the user types.  Toolbar buttons, code snippets and a selection of keyboard shortcuts, e.g. to wrap the current selection with an element, complement the editor. All this is fully configurable in the HTML. The Leiden+ and XML editors were released as separate, independently usable components.  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AA5RjIUxC7U?si=9qDQjzYdiaMpMDH3\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>   Outlook  Beyond the specialized field of epigraphy, EDEp provides a foundation for building more complex editing environments, using a mix of form-based entry, XML micro editors and plain text markup conventions like Leiden. It should be easy to see how this concept could be expanded to many other use cases. For sure some rough edges still need to be smoothed out, but thanks to EDEp, we consider the underlying components to be close to production-ready state.  Many parts of EDEp already found their way into TEI Publisher 9: the custom entity editing forms in the web-based annotation editor are based on Fore, also featuring the context-sensitive XML editor component for entering notes.  Extending EDEp, we would also like to see a well-documented, more generic – i.e. less focused on epigraphy – `teiHeader` editing environment in TEI Publisher to serve as a blueprint for other projects, allowing users to copy and paste the bits and pieces they need to support their particular workflow. But as always we would need to find some funding for this.  This would well fit into our plans for TEI Publisher 10, which will introduce the concept of “application profiles”, i.e. a collection of modular templates covering typical features of an edition project. This would include ready-to-use blueprints for specific edition types like correspondence, monography, dictionaries etc., but also workflow modules, which can be imported, e.g. the annotation editor. The goal is that users will be able to click together a digital edition in a Fore-based interface, choosing from the available blueprints, templates and modules without having to dive into the source code. An EDEp-like `teiHeader` editor would make a perfect new component, which can be customized to match the type of edition that is being created.

Unmaintained servers break down, sometimes they are intentionally switched off because they pose an unacceptable security or legal threat, sometimes the funding for hosting runs dry. The IT department often feels unfit, unwilling or, despite the best of efforts, unable to update the old system to assure its continued operation. Whatever the reason, these situations are never easy - not on the users and certainly not on those responsible for reviving the old systems.  The user reaction is not difficult to imagine when one day a resource they came to rely upon goes (and remains) down. Sometimes there are alternatives, like a print version, tedious to consult, and expensive to buy, but at least still available somewhere. Often, the thing is just gone without a trace. In both cases, a stream of polite (or desperate) enquiries ensues, triggering an emergency meeting at the institution originally hosting the project.   This is the moment for the assessment of the situation and, often, a wake up call. In the worst case, the old system is irreparably broken and there is no one available anymore who is familiar with its workflows and technical solutions. It may rarely get quite as dramatic for popular resources, but what does happen often is that documentation is scarce or virtually nonexistent, while the majority of the editorial and technical staff has moved on to pastures new, retired or passed away.    Challenges  In our line of work, as consultants and software developers, we find ourselves frequently called in as a last resort - to resurrect a project that already went dark or is tottering on the verge of collapse. If we're lucky, we can obtain a copy of the data in a reasonably processable form. Sometimes even there we need to jump through extra hoops: scraping old servers and databases or reconstructing the original sources from what remains available on the website. It can, of course, get even worse if the data is stored in obscure, proprietary formats. The first challenge, and a determining factor for success of restoring the project to its former glory, is therefore retrieving and subsequently converting the sources to a modern standard, a task usually involving readjusting the data model<sup>1</sup> and its organisation.  Once the question of data is resolved, things do start to look brighter but we're not yet out of the woods. Where we can consult the predecessor to determine the original functionalities, or have a usable documentation, we can create a draft specification for the new system. But uncritically reconstructing the old solution is rarely a good idea. Obviously, our users are consulting online resources in a variety of ways on different devices, therefore UX and accessibility questions, rarely pondered in older days, need to be taken into account. Secondly, modern systems allow us often to provide a much broader set of functionalities than original. Not to forget that many countries set certain standards for public websites, which must be legally met. Therefore, a reevaluation of the requirements is a critical second step resulting in an updated specification for the thus reinvented system.  One implicit but major responsibility in any such update is future-proofing the project and this concern gains prominence proportionally to the pains of the remake. From what has been said above, it should be clear that relying on standards for the encoding, good data organisation, as well as clear documentation, are critically important in this regard.   Case studies  In our presentation we would like to discuss challenges and solutions employed in very different projects which underwent such a reconstruction/reinvention process: *Alfred Escher-Briefedition*<sup>2</sup> (Zürich, Switzerland), *Lexicon of Greek Personal Names*<sup>3</sup> (Oxford, UK), *Register of Older Slovenian Manuscripts*<sup>4</sup> (Ljubljana, Slovenia) and *Neolatina*<sup>5</sup> (Kraków, Poland) and a few others. We will also analyze examples for which it remains so far impossible: *Bogactwa Mowy Polskiej*<sup>6</sup> (Warsaw, Poland) and *EBBE*<sup>7</sup> (Kraków, Poland).    Solutions  All these projects had their original data in very different formats (relational databases, custom XML, HTML, some in TEI) but all ended up using TEI and TEI Processing Model in their remake. Despite huge differences between these resources, for all of them we were able to design a new publication system based on the TEI Publisher's open source framework. While not imposing any arbitrary constraints on the encoding style or presentational aspects, thanks to a modular, customizable design founded on acknowledged and widely adopted standards (e.g. TEI, DocBook, JATS, web components, JSON, IIIF and OpenApi) we can accomodate virtually any, even radically heterogeneous, text-based scholarly publications, under one roof and assure they will stay safe for the future upgrades and maintenance in an interoperable environment.   Building on our own experiences, but also supported by a growing number of editions and other scholarly publications embracing our approach, we are confident to present a viable future-proof solution for a standards-based, sustainable, interoperable and open publication model.  At the time of writing there are already infrastructural endeavours at national and institutional level, such as Sources Online<sup>8</sup> in Switzerland and Jagiellonian Digital Platform<sup>9</sup> in Poland, which assume conformance with this publication model as a sine qua non requirement in accepting projects for long-term hosting on their respective platforms. We believe that we have created a sound conceptual foundation for the digital scholarly publications which has also been thoroughly battle-tested in practice.    The emerging community of practice which stays in touch through monthly online meetings under the banner of e-editiones<sup>10</sup> and daily Slack communications with about 350 members of the community channel, is a clear proof that these efforts are much appreciated. Yet, more importantly, it gives us both the responsibility to keep the project running, as well as hope that together we can indeed make it happen.

As in the case of other literatures, we have known Slovenian literature of the modern period only through the prism of printed books. Manuscripts have been neglected by older literary scholars. As a result, many Slovenian manuscripts from previous centuries are completely unknown.  That's why at the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, we have created the Register of Older Slovenian Manuscripts, using TEI Publisher to display our TEI encoded data. Each `<msDesc>` description combines four separate blocks of data according to the guidelines: identifier, manuscript content, codicological description and manuscript history.  This is a small but long-term project begun in 2011 that we are working on here and there, but it is an important support for other research. So far we have described 200 manuscripts in the register, for a half of them, digital images are provided (14.000 pages).  Most of the manuscripts are anonymous, but it has almost always been possible to determine whether a manuscript was written in a monastery, or by a diocesan priest, or in a bourgeois environment, or among peasants in a village, or by a churchwarden, or a schoolteacher, etc. We have therefore created a typology of these social contexts in which the manuscripts came into existence, and labelled our `<msDesc>` according to this typology. The TEI Publisher has shown excellent agility and speed in this and similar requests.  Our manuscript descriptions and digital facsimiles reveal a hitherto unknown reality: from the 17th to the 19th century, many texts were produced in Slovenian which, for economic and ideological reasons, could not be printed but were circulated only in transcript form. This has led to the discovery of a new phenomenon: the Slovenian manuscript culture of the Baroque period and its long-lived extensions into the 19th century.  If the printed book was the fundamental form of existence of Slovenian literature in the 16th century (or print coexisted with manuscripts, but the manuscripts perished), then in the 17th and 18th centuries it was the other way round: for a long time the manuscript was the fundamental form of existence of Slovenian literature, the book sometimes accompanied the manuscript, sometimes not. Our Register faithfully records the complicated relationships between printed books, which were no longer available in later times, and manuscripts, which restored and transmitted the texts of these inaccessible books.  Manuscript culture made writing and reading possible for both peasant writers and educated writers in the cities and in monasteries. It adapted flexibly to Slovenian dialects and to the wishes of people in small communities, which is why manuscript copying persisted stubbornly even into the 19th century.

We're working hard on TEI Publisher 10, which will bring a major redesign, but it's still a few weeks away. We therefore decided to roll out version 9.1.0, incorporating a few important fixes.   TEI Publisher on Windows  `tei-publisher-lib` 4.0.0 introduced a new, useful feature: within the ODD one could access variables and functions defined in TEI Publisher's main configuration module, `config.xqm` using the `global:` namespace. For example, to get the path to the application's data root collection one could use `$global:data-root`.  Unfortunately this feature causes failures on Windows (but only there as far as we know). The issue appears when you try to recompile an ODD or install a generated application. Users either got an unclear error message or the process silently failed.  The cause for this lies in the complexity of `config.xqm`, which itself imports a larger number of other files. On Windows, eXist-db (currently) fails to resolve those imports.  Instead of always importing the entire `config.xqm`, we decided to make it configurable: by default, TEI Publisher 9.1 will now import a dedicated configuration module, `odd-global.xqm`. You may either add the information you need within your ODD there, or create your own module and configure it in the global ODD configuration file, `configuration.xml`. See the updating section of the documentation for more information.   Access to HTTP request parameters  In some cases, trying to access HTTP request parameters from within an HTML template would fail. This happend at more or less random times. We added a workaround to avoid this.   Annotations  The release includes an important fix contributed by Boris Lehečka: when adding a note via the web annotation editor, it was inserted *before* the selected element. This is clearly not what you would expect for footnotes!  A revision panel was added to the editor, allowing users to describe the changes made before saving. Within the TEI header, this creates a `change` entry in the `revisionDesc` section, including username and timestamp.  !Revision panel in annotation editor{width=50%}  Finally, we fixed the annoying issue that the preview panels were not scrollable, therefore making it impossible to see and check all the changes or the full XML.   Try it ...  As usual you can try the latest version on the TEI Publisher homepage. Note that **write access is limited** on this server. To get the full experience, we suggest to install TEI Publisher locally. The easiest way is probably to use our docker images.  Updating from 9.0 to 9.1 requires only little changes. The procedure is described in the documentation. The good news: with TEI Publisher 10 updating will become **a lot easier**, hopefully working mostly automatic.

As a result, we are developing a model edition and writing an extensive handbook that aims to help different use cases and communities in the conception phase of their projects.  Proto4DigEd answers to a growing need for standardisation concerning digital edition projects (Pierazzo 2019: 2014). For this aim, the project links its handbook to its model edition, using a small subset of the huge correspondence of Gaston Paris (1839-1903), one of the most influent European philologists of the 19th century.  The Proto4DigEd handbook is concerned with all stages of the data life cycle from the conception phase until the archiving of the data in a repository. The project is not intended to document new technical solutions, but focuses on a combination of easily available, long-time proofed and thus sustainable tools and on seamless transitions between them.  It focuses mainly on three solutions for the main phases of a DSE project (transcribing, editing, publishing and archiving).  * 1. For the automated transcription of manuscripts (HTR) the tool Transkribus offers general text recognition models as well as the training of specific models and is at present the de-facto standard solution in DSE in the community.  * 2. TEI Publisher is a publishing toolbox developed in Switzerland and Germany that is supported by a growing community and allows standardised markup of texts in TEI-XML and their online publication.  * 3. The DaSCH Service Platform (DSP) allows long-term archiving and long-term visualisation of edition data. The handbook informs readers about different ways in which to use these or similar solutions, that fit the technical, personal and institutional framework of their projects.  We are organising workshops, in which we discuss and compare workflows of different projects and ask them for their best practices. The focus is on the question of how projects can learn from each other, despite their differences. Sharing experiences when deciding on certain workflows and the use of tools is proving to be particularly promising. It is particularly important to consciously reflect on which functionalities are necessary and which are ‘just’ nice to have. Our community driven handbook is based on MkDocs and will be made available on the GitLab instance of the University of Zurich from autumn 2024. The Center Digital Editions & Edition Analytics, ZDE UZH, helps in sharing the workflow and offers discussion and training to any interested project.

Exploring this reason means investigating commonalities and differences between the texts contained in the collection. In one example - the project The School of Salamanca of the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz - the relation between the texts is precisely one of the things the exploration of which the project intends to facilitate. For would understanding this relation not help us understand what the \"school\" might have been? In what ways?  For reasons of path dependencies, the platform of the project is not based on TEI Publisher, but it may serve as an example of what working with embeddings in such a context might involve anyway: For which parts of texts would you create embeddings, how and where would you store them, how would you access and process them, and what information would you want to provide to users of the platform based on these embeddings? The presentation reports on an ongoing experiment the core of which is the definition of an API handling the storage, comparison, and delivery of embeddings (the API of a vector store, then) on the one hand, and a proposal of how to extend APIs for handling (lists or passages of) texts with affordances based on embeddings (the API of a digital collection of sources, that is).

As such it can become an important ingredient for a fully declarative specification of TEI output, even though a declarative output specification would need much more than the PM (such as page layout specifications, search specifications, specification of interaction). However, there are a number of limitations that one runs into when trying to define output using the TEI PM. For some of these, TEI publisher has already implemented extensions to the model.   In my talk I will focus on two aspects of this. First I will discuss situations where we need to associate multiple, nested, behaviours with one element (such as an image that should also be a link or a text section that should have a generated header). Second, I will look at the way the processing model is now specified at element level within the TEI schema specification. I will argue that from the perspective of reusability this is an unfortunate choice, and that we should be able to define named rule blocks containing TEI PM elements. It should be possible to call these rule blocks from the interface definition. In the situation where an edition consists of multiple components, it should also be possible for a rule block from one component to activate a rule block in another component.   I have implemented some of these ideas in proof-of-concept coding. In the talk I will show how this could work and, as this is very much work in progress, I look forward to suggestions and ideas from the audience.  <iframe width=\"1117\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S71Ntbt2rs0\" title=\"Peter Boot: Extending (and reorganizing?) the TEI Processing Model\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  * Recording: Youtube ","tags":["events","meetups"]},{"id":"/posts/community-event-tei-publisher-10-preview/","title":"A preview of TEI Publisher 10","content":" Community meetup on February 04, 2025 at 17:00 CET.  - Recording: Youtube  TEI Publisher Version 10 represents a radical redesign by deconstructing TEI Publisher into an ensemble of combinable, interoperable profiles, each of which targets a particular aspect of a digital edition. Profiles can be rearranged and adjusted via configuration files (in the future: via form-based interface).   This reduces the need to touch actual code or copy and paste code snippets between projects (as we currently often do). Generating a custom app is no longer a one time task, but becomes an iterative process. This also means that updates to newer versions of publisher can be done largely automatic, further reducing long term maintenance costs.  In addition, TP 10 includes an option to generate static versions of an entire application or parts thereof, as well as a completely new HTML templating engine.  The goal of this first presentation is to give you an overview of the overall design and enable all members of the community to bring in their own ideas and contributions. Each profile in TP 10 and beyond should ideally serve as a best practice example, which means that if you follow the specs laid out, you can be sure your data will display nicely out of the box. To achieve this goal we´ll need everyone in the community, not just those who can code!  <iframe width=\"1117\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/--_RAW9SbY8\" title=\"A preview of TEI Publisher 10\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  - Recording: Youtube","tags":["events","meetups"]},{"id":"/posts/community-event-hans-christian-andersen-genetic-editing/","title":"Genetic editions of Hans Christian Andersen's oeuvre","content":" Community meetup on March 04, 2025 at 17:00 CET.  - Presentation: PDF - Recording: Youtube  Hans Christian Andersen died 150 years ago, but his legacy is thriving. The research center in Andersen´s native town Odense aids readers and researchers alike who want to explore this rich oeuvre. To this aim, we have over the course of just four years launched three digital editions. All three have been produced with TEI Publisher.  In the talk at the community meetup, I first outline the process that helped us at the centre to reach to the current state.  Secondly, I then single out three building blocks that are either new additions to TEI Publisher or could become such:  * Fast search through tables, e.g., on the main landing page (via zing-grid adapted by Magdalena Turska). * Draggable panels with display of, e.g., facsimiles (jsPanel adapted by Jörn Turner). * Synoptic visualizations of two, three or more textual variants (via CollateX customized by Karsten Kynde).  As the names in the parentheses indicate, the modules have been crafted by experts within our community. The talk should thereby demonstrate how TEI Publisher delivers one of its main promises: Empowering academics (like myself) to model and build digital scholarly editions without having to become programmers.  In the final dialogue we might discuss whether the two latter building blocks could be bundled with related elements to form a distinct genetic profile in future versions of TEI Publisher? This might aid the creation of coming genetic digital scholarly editions.

Just over a year ago, we began editing the letters of the music publishers and composers Hans Georg Nägeli (1773-1836) and Hermann Nägeli (1811-1872). The Nägeli Letter Edition is one of two pilot projects through which the Zentralbibliothek Zürich (ZB) is developing services in the field of digital editing. The letter edition is designed to be as generic as possible so that future projects can utilize the same infrastructure.  Our workflow is based on Transkribus, an Anton database, markup in oXygen, and publication with the TEI Publisher. In our presentation, we will discuss lessons learned and ongoing work. One of the challenges is the reuse of newly cataloged letter metadata. These metadata, determined by library standards, must be expanded and repeatedly transformed within the framework of the edition, as we will show.

The publication of the Finnish national epic, Elias Lönnrot’s Kalevala, in 1835 awakened a national idealism, inspiring a large number of university students to follow in Lönnrot’s footsteps to collect folk poetry. The majority of the original folk poetry thus collected was published by the Finnish Literature Society in the first half of the 20th century in in 33 printed volumes, containing some 89 000 Kalevala-metre texts in total. Some 20 years ago, this series, called Suomen Kansan Vanhat Runot, or SKVR in short (The Ancient Songs of the Finnish People), was made into an SQL-based database.   The SKVR collection is of major importance folklore studies and other fields of Humanities scholarships as well as to individuals in non-academic fields, such as folk musicians and authors seeking inspiration for their work. However, by 2024 the old database was in dire need of modernization, with improved features to better serve the needs of researchers. We’d successfully used eXist-db and TEI Publisher for some years for smaller digital editions, the largest one up to then containing images of c. 10 000 archival index cards with transcriptions, so they felt like the best tools for our modernization project. One of the major benefits of eXist-db and TEI Publisher, for us, is that as open source software they allow us to control the entire process ourselves, from design to building work to possible changes and improvements based on user feedback.   The new database would contain not only the original c. 89 000 texts but also a new collection of c. 84 000 texts which had not been included in the original printed series for various reasons. In our project we had quite specific requirements for features: e.g. a complicated, three- or four-level genre categorization; multi-selection within facets; enabling users to select which collection to query; fielded queries. Performance was a major concern, especially with regard to the catalogue views with facets. We could split the original SKVR and the new dataset of unsorted poems into two separate catalogue views, but nearly 90 000 TEI documents per dataset is still a lot to load into a HTML view with facets. One way to (further) improve performance would have been to limit the facet listings to show e.g. the first 50 entries initially, but felt it wasn’t a solution in this case: with this kind of data, the facets themselves offer a wealth of information on the genres, collectors, collection regions, places and years of the poems – information that is updated in real time when the users makes facet selections. If a user wants to know, say, where and when a specific person collected poetry or which regions yielded epic poems, the facets reveal that information immediately.   The rebuilding and modernization project has been a learning experience in many ways, and challenging too, not the least because of the expectations of various existing user groups with different needs. It has shown us concretely that eXist-db and TEI Publisher indeed work well with large datasets. The experiences gained during the project will be used and hopefully improved upon in forthcoming large-scale publishing projects.

A digital edition of the correspondence of Jewish emigrees from Münster","content":" Community meetup on June 03, 2025 at 17:00 CET. **The talk will not be recorded!**  With the project Exile Letters the Institute for Comparative Urban History (IStG) in Münster publishes correspondences of Jewish families from Münster separated by emigration, flight, and deportation during the era of Nationalsocialism. The first collection of the project was published in December 2024 and consists of 162 letters of Simon Friedeman, a Jewish scholar who emigrated to London 1939, and his wife Gerda, who shortly afterwards managed to escape to the Netherlands and further to the US in 1940, as well as letters and postcards of the Friedeman family in Argentinia, Gerda's siblings in the USA, Argentinia, and Palestine and her parents, Henny and Carl Waldeck, who remained in Münster until they were deported to Theresienstadt in 1942 and murdered in 1944.  <img src=\"/img/exile-letter.png\" alt=\"Image Uni Muenster\" width=\"100%\"/>   The origins of the project date back to the late 1980s, when Rita Schlautmann-Overmeyer and her colleague Gisela Möllenhoff began interviewing former Jewish citizens of Münster. The idea for publishing the \"Friedeman-Waldeck\" collection was born in 2016, when after Gerda's death a box of letters was found by her daughter.  Originally conceptualized as a book publication, the decision to prepare a digital TEI edition instead was made in 2021. Soon afterwards, the TEI Publisher was chosen as a tool for publication and presentation. Re-conceptualising an analogue edition into a digital one is, it seems, still a common challenge of projects that started before digital editions became more of a standard. The presentation will focus on the development of the Exile Letters project, the current features as well as some remaining obstacles of the digital edition available under exileletters.de.

The stories have been OCR-ed and annotated (in the TEI-Publisher v7 annotator) for people, places and themes, resulting in an extensive TEI-XML corpus which is still expanding. To enable both close and distant reading of the corpus, a browser was built using standard programming frameworks and techniques (.Net Blazor, served from Azure) enabling a flexible and specialized UI and Ux, with complex and multilevel faceting. The browser incorporates TEI-Publisher HTML5 components to display the editions (facsimile and text) as well as the individual stories with additional information. Custom endpoints built with the TEI-Publisher infrastructure use XQuery to extract the relevant information from the corpus as a whole and from individual documents.
