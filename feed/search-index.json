While digital editions may differ considerably in structure and content, there is a large overlap in terms of the basic technical functionality that each edition must offer. Starting point for the initiators of the Society is their shared use of TEI Publisher – which originated from a project of the TEI community. This toolbox allows editions to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way.  However, such software requires a constant exchange between developers and users, who are familiar with the technical requirements of their respective edition projects. The Society would like to put this exchange of information as well as the communication between edition projects on a firm footing.

"},{"id":"/pages/strategy/","title":"Strategy","content":"  e-editiones: Focus of the Society  The focus of the the e-editiones society rests on 4 pillars:  1. Initiating and Coordinating Developments in Open Source Software for Digital Editions 2. Promotion of Information Exchange and Communication between the stakeholders involved 3. Fundraising for the purposes of the society 4. Ensuring long term availability of digital editions   1\\. Initiating and Coordinating Developments in Open Source Software for Digital Editions  The society promotes the use of open standards and open source software for digital editions. While digital editions may differ considerably in structure and content, there is great overlap in the basic technical functionality that each edition must offer. Small projects often face the challenge of publishing an edition under time pressure and with limited resources and would benefit from access to free, open source. standards-based software that could provide much of this functionality out of the box. All projects, including those that are well-resourced, would benefit from such software, by avoiding the need to reinvent the wheel and incur high development and maintenance costs, which threaten their long term sustainability.  The society therefore focuses on the promotion of open source, standard-based software. Editions should be able to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way, achieving quick solutions at low cost, but without being forced into a corset, neither technically nor scholarly.  The society therefore focuses on the promotion of open source, standard-based software. Editions should be able to reuse existing building blocks in a modular way, achieving quick solutions at low cost, but without being forced into a technical or scholarly corset. The starting point for the founders of the society is their shared use of TEI Publisher, which meets above conditions:  1. TEI Publisher is consistently based on TEI and related standards such as ODD and TEI Processing Model; 2. TEI Publisher is implemented as a toolbox: the entire user interface consists of small components complying with W3C standards, which can be recombined and reassembled as needed; 3. TEI Publisher supports exchange and communication between different editions; and 4. as a free, open source software project TEI Publisher enables and stimulates competition between commercial service providers serving the publishing industry.  The society thus initially aims to further support the development of TEI Publisher and TEI Publisher-based projects. However, such software cannot be created in isolation. Rather, it requires a constant exchange between developers and users, who are familiar with the technical requirements of their respective edition projects. This is how TEI Publisher originated—as an initiative of the TEI Community and has since been continuously developed in interaction with a large number of projects. The Society would like to provide a stable and productive forum for this exchange of information, but it does not limit itself specifically to TEI Publisher.  Direct communication between edition projects is also central: instead of having to solve the same problems over and over again, projects should benefit from the experience and developments of other editions. In most cases, the technical requirements of an edition can already be covered with existing building blocks. Where this does not suffice and new blocks are needed, edition projects should coordinate with others to avoid duplicate developments. If possible, new building blocks should be created in a generic way so that other editions can easily adapt them to their requirements. To do this, the project’s context has to be extended beyond the single edition and a broader perspective needs to be adopted.  It is a main objective of the society to coordinate such developments and channel existing funds or funding applications in a way that supports sustainability, from which all members derive long term benefits.   2\\. Promotion of Information Exchange and Communication between the stakeholders involved  A second important goal of the society is to promote a constant exchange of information between the members. This includes establishing a communication platform open to all members for questions, suggestions, and other contributions.  However, based on our experience with open source projects, we know that such communication only works in the long run if there are responsible individuals taking on a coordination role, overseeing requests, and, if necessary, referring communications to the right people. The society therefore intends to appoint a secretary who will take on these responsibilities and be available as a contact person for all members.  In addition to electronic communication, the society also plans workshops, seminars, and talks—or arranges these on request. It can often be assumed that the projects themselves have funds to cover travel costs. However, this is not always the case. The society should therefore be able to cover part of the costs from membership fees—e.g., travel expenses or a compensation for invited experts.  The society also actively seeks members and promotes sustainable solutions—e.g., through conference talks or workshops.   3\\. Fundraising for the purposes of the society  The society can support its members in writing project funding applications, or it can apply for funding itself and in this case represent the interests of all members. All software development shall be for the benefit of the general public and must be available for further use as open source.   4\\. Ensuring long term availability of digital editions  Especially for smaller edition projects with limited resources, hosting can be a massive problem. Running a server and maintaining the associated infrastructure is expensive and requires constant commitment, which likely extends beyond the planned duration of the project. And even if hosting is provided by an institutional service infrastructure, those institutions’ own resource constraints may limit their role to providing updates and minimal maintenance only, a tragic pattern that too often leads services to become partially or completely inaccessible after a few years.  The society is therefore committed to ensuring that public memory institutions (i.e., archives, libraries, and universities) provide the editions on a long-term basis. The society wants to dramatically lower the cost and effort for institutions charged with maintaining the editions. In early 2020, the swissuniversities project, Nationale Infrastruktur Editionen (NIE-INE), sponsored improvements to TEI Publisher to facilitate long-term updates and enable shared hosting of heterogeneous edition projects on one platform. The society also assists edition projects to secure a (public) provider for the time after the completion of the funding period and plan for the long-term archiving of the project’s raw data.  Since the entire software is freely available, it is also possible for infrastructure providers to set up a corresponding service. The society explicitly welcomes and supports this.

Giuliano Di Bacco and Dennis Ried introduced us to MEI and challenges of publishing MEI and MEI-in-TEI collections on the web (see slides). Wolfgang Meier presented early results of his work on integration of MEI into the TEI Publisher.  !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@marius?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Marius Masalar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/music?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>    As we learned from Giuliano's and Dennis' introduction _MEI, like the TEI, is an umbrella term which simultaneously describes an organization, a research community, and a markup language_ (music-encoding.org). It's almost 20 years since the first public presentation of the XML schema created by Perry Roland (Univ. of Virginia) for the representation of music notation. Now it has become a thriving community of around 400 members worldwide, specialists from various music research groups, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists.  This open-source effort to define guidelines for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure draws in many aspects on TEI: using an ODD metalanguage to define both the schema and encoding guidelines, dividing the document into metadata, facsimile and text parts, recording logical and structural divisions of the document (albeit named differently) or \"borrowing\" a number of element names from TEI to deal with metadata, textual content, critical apparatus, linking etc.  Nevertheless, MEI was designed to specialize in the encoding of music documents, therefore MEI data is predominantly about the meaning of the music notation: notes, rests, chords, measures. That said MEI allows for multiple additional layers of annotations:  - about the visual aspects of the notation, and/or of the features of a physical copy of a score - metadata - editorial markup  While MEI encoding allows for sophisticated analysis of various features of the musical piece, rendering of MEI documents often poses a substantial challenge. We need to consider that music notation is a very complex system; actually, many systems were developed since the medieval times, and MEI strives to give a sophisticated representation not only of the symbols but of their meaning and of the logic that brings them together in pieces of music of all ages. However, it is still difficult, if not impossible, to render graphically all the nuances of the encoding.  Major breakthrough in this respect has been the creation of the Verovio music engraving library which is considered the most advanced solution in the field to generate score visualisations in SVG.  Verovio is quite helpful to render the notation for the most common use cases for MEI:  - to create transcriptions/editions of music pieces - to produce bibliographies and catalogs  Difficulties arise when we need to deal with mixed textual and musical content: from music treatises (see Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum), composers’ letters quoting musical phrases, to opera librettos and listening guides, papers including snippets of music notation (e.g. music textbooks)... Such situations often require the simultaneous use of both TEI and MEI (and for instance a MEI file can be referenced in a TEI document using the \\`\\` element). Giuliano and Dennis walked us through a number of different approaches employed in various projects, where tools specialized just for a single vocabulary do not meet their ideal criteria for broad application:  - ease of setting up - TEI and MEI support - facsimile integration  Following this cue, Wolfgang has demonstrated his new pb-mei web component which uses Verovio under the hood to generate SVG representation of the score. For TEI documents applying \\`\\` element to include a pointer to a MEI encoding of a music notation it is very straightforward to adjust the ODD to transform this pointer to a pb-mei component, as demonstrated in the pb-mei demo.  !Demo page of the pb-mei component  This proved to be a very pleasant surprise and a convincing argument that TEI Publisher could be adapted to fit the needs of MEI community. A short discussion followed ranging from detailed questions on MEI encoding, through workflows on creating MEI sources cf. Verovio editor to information important for preparing an ODD and customization modules for supporting MEI in TEI Publisher. We agreed to work with Giuliano and Dennis on including MEI-in-TEI and pure MEI examples in the next minor version of the TEI Publisher to demonstrate fully its capability.  We were happy to see that this event gathered the audience of around 17 participants and are looking forward to establishing a monthly meetup online to provide an arena for lively discussions on subjects of interest to the community. Please get in touch if you'd like to discuss a particular topic.

The event will take place online at 4pm CET on October 20th, 2020.  Many of us at some point expressed their frustration with starting a TEI project. Without previous experience with this extensive and robust vocabulary the learning curve may be quite steep and the whole process overwhelming.  TEI Vanilla is a grassroots movement to help newcomers to the TEI community in smooth on-boarding. We feel that a number of prospective users, both individual and institutional, would benefit from a gentler introduction than TEI's excellent but extensive Guidelines provide.  Vanilla is meant to pick up where earlier 2015 TEI Simple project, led by the late Sebastian Rahtz, Martin Mueller and Brian Pytlik-Zillig, left off. As some of you would remember, main outcome of the TEI Simple was the TEI Processing Model, now lying at the heart of the TEI Publisher. Nevertheless, the other goal envisioned for Simple was creating a schema which would provide a good starting point for majority, if not most, larger scale editorial projects. We based our selection on a survey of usage through large volume corpora, among them EEBO-TCP and DTA, and believed it to be a solid 80/20 solution: addressing 80% of users needs with 20% of the effort and heartache.  Thanks to the space for discussion on e-editiones Slack we found out there are many like-minded individuals willing to join forces in the work of reviewing the schema and working on its own dedicated Guidelines and a body of examples, tutorials and other auxiliary resources.  At this point we would like to share our motivations and preliminary goals but above all solicit opinions, perspectives and requirements from our community. Join us for the event and share your thoughts on Slack. "},{"id":"/posts/tei-vanilla-meeting-summary/","title":"TEI \"Vanilla\" meeting summary","content":" Following the spontaneous exchange on e-editiones Slack channel, we have held an online community meeting to discuss the emerging TEI Vanilla proposal on October 20th. It was a pleasure to see such a broad interest and diverse representation of participants, spanning the entire range from TEI newcomers to current and former TEI Council and Board members.  Main motivation for what Martin Mueller and I initially codenamed TEI Vanilla were recurring voices expressing frustration of starting a TEI project. Without previous experience with this extensive and robust vocabulary the learning curve may be quite steep and the whole process overwhelming. During the meeting we had a chance to hear many opinions on history, theory, practice and local circumstances of conducting a TEI project. These voices cannot be easily reconciled but form an excellent base for further discussion.  Nevertheless, there was a shared agreement on certain shortcomings in the availability of:  - introductory and advanced material for self-study - curated repository of extensive examples in different languages and covering different domains - critical commentary focusing on the bigger picture and decision making through the whole process: from encoding to publishing  Similarly, we agreed during the meeting, that a particular customization tied to a schema, following the path of TEI Lite or TEI Simple is at the moment a secondary concern. Rather a “kleine Katechismus”, presenting main concepts and considerations in a linear progression is sorely missed. Naturally, there’s no single path through the richness of the TEI but we imagine such an introductory guide would embrace the 80/20 approach and focus on issues relevant for virtually all projects.  All these postulates are not new and there is a lot of diverse material dispersed through the web already. TEI website and wiki pages try to point its user towards projects, tools and tutorials. Nevertheless, these lists, or resources they refer to, are often dated or fragmentary, therefore do not give an adequate overview, particularly of emerging practices.  It is obvious that gathering and preparing resources helpful for broad spectre of TEI users is a task both daunting as well as never-ending, and can only be undertaken and then maintained within the interested communities of practice themselves. e-editiones society sees its important role in providing a space for publication and coordinating efforts on preparation of guides, tutorials and best practice recommendations for digital editions and would like to invite you to submit proposals for:  - guest blog posts on e-editiones.org covering various aspects of preparing and publishing a digital edition - TEI-encoded samples for various domains - accompanying ODD schema and processing model customizations  You can discuss and submit proposals via TEI Vanilla issue tracker.  PS We hoped to provide a recording of our online meeting and did not minute it. Unfortunately, due to a technical glitch, the recording quality is insufficient for publication. I am very sorry for this and would like to encourage other participants to share their perspectives, opinions and points for discussion I might have missed in this summary.

For the Karl Barth edition project, we have thus created a new extension for Visual Studio Code (vscode) and published it as Open Source.   Where it all started: a Word plugin  Within the Karl Barth edition, texts to be published in new volumes are encoded in Microsoft Word and transformed to TEI using TEI Publisher's powerful docx2TEI conversion feature based on the TEI processing model.  To simplify semantic encoding, eXist Solutions created a **Word plugin** for the project, which allows editors to easily encode entities occurring within the text: select a string representing an entity, click a button and the plugin will run a query against the database of the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, showing potential matches for each possible category.  With another click, the selected entity is inserted into the Word document, including a reference to the entity in the database. This proved to be a huge timesaver: what took minutes before - switching to a different window, doing a search and copying the ID - is now done in seconds. A screenshot of the Word plugin is shown below:  !MS Word screenshot  The plugin also allows editors to get a preview of how the current text would look like in TEI and how it would be rendered to HTML by TEI Publisher's ODD-based transformations. The preview feature sends the underlying Word XML to a TEI Publisher instance, which transforms it first to TEI, and then - if requested - to HTML. Editors can thus see the text as it would later appear on the website.   Porting it to Visual Studio Code  However, the Word-workflow only covers the new volumes: we still have 54 already published volumes in TEI, which need to be extended. Parts of this is done automatically (via entity detection), but there's still a lot of manual editing involved. Thus the question arised if the Word plugin could be ported to an XML editor.  For sure, oXygen would have been the obvious choice, but since the Word Plugin was already written in javascript/typescript, we decided to give Visual Studio Code a try. It turned out to be rather straightforward and the first usable version was done within one evening. Thrilled by the success, we invested two more days to make the plugin more generic, in particular, add connectors for other authority databases. Beyond the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, we now have connectors for the German GND, metagrid, Geonames and Google places.  !Enity lookup screencast  The TEI snippet to be inserted for each of the entity types can be configured in the settings. For example, you could replace `<persName>` with `<name type=\"person\">` if you like.   Previews  The HTML preview feature has been ported as well: pressing a keyboard shortcut or clicking the toolbar icon will present you with a list of ODDs available for transformations, and then open a new editor panel showing the transformation result in HTML. All you need is a TEI Publisher 7 instance which has a matching ODD installed. The plugin uses the general API introduced with TEI Publisher 7, which will also be exposed automatically by any application generated from it.  !HTML preview screencast   Snippets  Finally, it is rather straightforward to create reusable snippets in vscode. To start with, we implemented the one shortcut we use most in oXygen and miss everywhere else: wrap the current selection with an element (the Scholarly XML extension described below also has this, but it doesn't hurt to have it twice in case you're not using that).  And since we have to encode a lot of foreign texts, we also added one for `<foreign>`. Doing more would be easy: maybe you have some suggestions? Just write them into our github issues.   Combine with other extensions  If you combine this with other extensions available on the vscode marketplace, you get rather decent XML editing support - not as sophisticated as with oXygen, but good enough for some serious work.  For schema-based validation and context sensitive suggestions one can choose between two extensions: Scholary XML is lightweight and provides nice suggestions with documentation. It only understands relax-ng though and does not support catalogs, which means you need to reference the schema via a processing instruction in every TEI file. The second option, XML Language Support by Red Hat, supports XML schema and catalogs, which you can use to associate the TEI namespace with a schema once and for all. On the downside, it uses more system resources as it starts a background Java process.  To set up a catalog, just create a file `catalog.xml` somewhere with e.g. the following content and change the vscode configuration property `xml.catalogs` to point to it:    Finally, if you use TEI Publisher as a basis for your own editions, you definitely want to install the Language Server and Client for XQuery/eXistdb. It supports working on XQuery files, syncing your local changes with the database, installing XAR files and more.   Get it  The extension is available from Microsoft's Visual Studio Marketplace. To install it in your own Visual Studio Code, just open the _Extensions_ tab and search for `tei-publisher-vscode`.  All source code is available on the e-editiones github and we would like to invite others to further extend it, e.g. by adding connectors to other authority APIs. Connectors are simple javascript/typescript classes with just two methods. See the existing connectors for inspiration.  If you have questions, suggestions or would like to discuss further extensions: you'll find us in the e-editiones slack rooms.

Usually the problem to solve would be the great diversity of encoding across projects, even if they all use TEI as a vocabulary of choice. Even commonly represented information, like the language of the source document, can be stored in various locations in a TEI document. Lucene-based fields and facets, introduced in eXist-db 5.0 provide a mechanism to smoothly abstract away these encoding differences - we can just define, say, a _language_ facet and it's the collection index configuration's role to take care of specifying where exactly to grab data from.  The next potential issue would be actually running the queries across corpora, particularly with the decentralized infrastructure where editions are hosted on diverse servers. The answer here is to define an API which individual editions need to expose, so that the aggregate search engine can just poll all its registered 'members', regardless of their location or how they implement the search internally.  !Cross-search results page  The cross-search prototype is exactly such a search engine. With a simple configuration one can register all 'member' editions. Only requirement for the editions themselves is that they expose the `api/search/document` API endpoint, which is a matter of simple customization for all TEI Publisher 7 applications which support Open API specifications out of the box. The `api/search/document` endpoint must accept a number of parameters defined in the specification. For this prototype the title, author and lang(uage) fields as well as genre, language and corpus facets were assumed.  We are very happy to report that our prototype works really well as a proof of concept with the eclectic collection of documents from TEI Publisher demo apps, all originating with vastly different projects with diverse encoding styles. Next, we intend to extend this idea into a general portal for archives and libraries and we would welcome collaboration from such institutions.  Our sincere thanks go to the Bibliothek für Bildungsgeschichtliche Forschung des DIPF / Research Library for the History of Education at DIPF for supporting this project."},{"id":"/posts/roaster-an-open-api-router-for-exist/","title":"Roaster: an Open API Router for eXist","content":" !{.left width=220} We're happy to announce that the request routing library, which was originally developed for TEI Publisher 7, has been released as a separate package with extended functionality. The library, called **roaster**, is generic and can be used for any eXist-based project. It implements the Open API 3.0 standard to support well-documented, versioned and formally specified APIs.   Background  In previous versions of TEI Publisher, clients (i.e. your web browser) would communicate with the server by directly calling a variety of XQuery scripts. The server-side API, if you can even call it one, was thus scattered over many different files. Finding your way through the code, figuring out what parameters are expected or how the response should look like was rather difficult. Overwriting the default behaviour - e.g. to replace the generated table of contents - required substantial coding skills. The scripts also changed between TEI Publisher versions. So, if you were working on a standalone edition generated from Publisher, updates could be tricky.  With TEI Publisher 7, the entire server-side API can be viewed on a single documentation page. It clearly describes the URL paths you can use, as well as any parameter you can pass in and the type it should conform to. One can also see the different possible responses and what kind of content they would return.   The new API  Looking at the first route of the _documents_ section in the API (see screenshot below), it is easy to construct a URL which returns the source XML: the path template to use is `/api/document/{id}` and `{id}` should contain the path to a document - relative to the data root of TEI Publisher.  !Documents API screenshot  So to retrieve the TEI/XML for _Graves' letter_, located in the file path `test/graves6.xml`, we can use the following URL:  https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml  Note that the / in the path needs to be URL encoded with `%2F`. This is a requirement of the Open API specification.  If instead of the TEI/XML we would like to see the letter rendered to HTML, we can use the third route in the list and simply add `/html` to the end of the URL:  https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml/html  or if we prefer a PDF:  https://teipublisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/api/document/test%2Fgraves6.xml/pdf  For sure, as an ordinary user, you don't need to know any of this: using the web interface of TEI Publisher, the web components on the page take care of constructing and calling above URLs for you. But if you are a developer, having a well-defined API is a game changer. Just imagine that you want to support your co-workers with a script which allows them to preview a local TEI document as HTML on the fly: sending the content of the document with an HTTP POST request to `/api/preview` is all you need! Our Visual Studio Code plugin does it like this.  You can use any script or programming language you like, say bash, python, perl - you name it. And because Open API is a widely used standard, there are plenty of tools for documentation, testing or code generation. The API documentation page in TEI Publisher is generated by such a tool (Swagger UI).   Implementation  **roaster** is essentially an implementation of the Open API standard in pure XQuery. It reads the formal API specification (in JSON format) and determines for each HTTP request coming in, which route to take. It will also check if the parameters, headers or request bodies passed in comply to the rules given in the definition of the route. An error will be generated if the request is not in compliance with the definition, e.g. because a required parameter is missing or has a wrong type. It can also fill in default values for parameters, enforce correct content types for the response etc.  From a developer perspective, this means you don't have to worry about parameters. Your handler function will receive a single parameter, containing all the necessary information about the request and you can safely assume that it complies with the spec you provided.  If you are interested in the details, please refer to the README. For a TEI Publisher-related example, check out the FAQ article, which describes how to replace the default table of contents with a custom one.  Roaster 1.0.0 can be installed into your local eXist via the package manager in the dashboard. TEI Publisher 7 shipped with a slightly older version, 0.5.1., but you can run both versions side by side."},{"id":"/posts/newsletter-2021-1/","title":"Newsletter 21/1","content":" !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bank_phrom?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Bank Phrom</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/news?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>  We're happy to send our first newsletter covering the past year of activities and developments within e-editiones and would like to encourage institutions or individuals who are not yet members to join forces.   e-editiones as a Society  The e-editiones society was founded on 4 May 2020 by more than 20 international partners.

TEI Publisher Developments: Versions 6 and 7  In 2020 two major versions of TEI Publisher were released: versions 6 and 7. The plan for these versions was born during a meeting in Basel in November 2019, when several Swiss edition projects using TEI Publisher came together to discuss how the software could be developed into an even more sustainable platform. A number of them later became founding members of e-editiones. Their primary goal was to enable institutions to manage and maintain a larger number of editions, either on the same or several servers. To reduce maintenance costs, keeping editions up to date with newer TEI Publisher versions needed to be as simple as possible. Editions relying on different versions needed to be able to run alongside each other.  Two areas had to be addressed to achieve these goals:  1. On the **client side** TEI Publisher was already a collection of small, modular web components, which together formed the user interface. These components had to be extracted into a separate library, so projects could benefit from bug fixes and new components without having to update the rest of the edition's application. 2. On the **server side** TEI Publisher needed a well defined API. Such an API would provide a standardized communication channel, through which the web components on the client could talk to the server. To accommodate future updates and support backwards compatibility, the API would need to be versioned, ensuring that both sides could speak the same language.  Fortunately the _Swiss Nationale Infrastruktur für Editionen – Infrastructure nationale pour les éditions_ agreed to support the outlined ideas, funding a substantial part of the work.  With the release of TEI Publisher 7, both areas mentioned above have been addressed and the goal has been fully reached.  Contributions also came from member institutions: the Collection of Swiss Law Sources Online and the St. Galler Missiven were built on an early version of TEI Publisher 4. Both funded a major update of their code to version 7. A number of regressions and new bugs were encountered during the migration, and appropriate fixes were contributed back into the TEI Publisher code base.  The Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe likewise served as a test bed during TEI Publisher 7 development. Furthermore, the Karl Barth project financed the Microsoft Word to TEI transformation, which is now part of TEI Publisher.  The source code of TEI Publisher and its related repositories have been moved under the roof of e-editiones and are hosted within its GitHub organization.   Other Software Packages  Beyond TEI Publisher itself, e-editiones released a number of other software packages:  - The Open API routing library at the heart of TEI Publisher 7, called Roaster, proved to be useful even outside the humanities and has already been adopted by a project in the medical realm. - Born out of the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe, e-editiones published an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor to help editors work on TEI. This includes an entity explorer to help with the markup of entities in a text by querying external authority databases from within the XML editor. - The Cross Search package provides a blueprint for a portal incorporating multiple editions, supporting cross-edition search facilities. This will become the basis for future hosting services.   Community Contributions  Last but not least, we would like to point out the many contributions we received with respect to translations: TEI Publisher has now been translated to more than 20 languages!  We hope to see similar interest in other areas, e.g., the newly established FAQ website. We would like to encourage everyone to add entries and turn this into a knowledge base for all users. It already hosts questions and answers concerning encoding, workflows, or best practice recommendations.   The Future  Continuing our cooperative development model, the following new components and features are scheduled to appear in the forthcoming minor version of TEI Publisher:  - A component for displaying mathematical formulae, sponsored by the Bernoulli project (Uni Basel). - A feature to automatically register persistent DOI identifiers with every resource uploaded to TEI Publisher (financed by the DIPF).  e-editiones is actively apply for funding: a first proposal has been sent to a Swiss foundation, and we're waiting for feedback. The features we hope to obtain sponsorship for include:  - Better navigation within an edition by allowing arbitrary identification schemes for resources. - Speaking and bookmarkable URLs. - Improved accessibility. - A timeline component. - Components to improve the editorial workflow:     - Git integration into the user interface for synchronization.     - An annotation feature allowing editions to perform semantic markup tasks directly on the rendered text.  If you have other features on your list, please do not hesitate to propose them. We can achieve more at lower costs if we all work together. If you need a certain feature and plan to apply for funding, why not ask other projects which may have similar requirements? e-editiones is a welcoming umbrella under which your project can come together with other projects from different academic disciplines, coordinate needs, and potentially convince funding agencies to look beyond the perspective of a single project.

It is offering comprehensive, long-term support and maintenance to keep digital editions from going dark. The offer is **available to all interested editions** world-wide.  The offer will be complemented by a portal, which allows users to search across all editions participating in the service. The portal application has been developed by e-editiones, Archives Online and the Staatsarchiv Zürich, and will go online as soon as the first editions are ready for publication. All code will be made available as free software. The distributed search feature was based on earlier work financed by the DIPF Berlin (Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education), and the Karl Barth-Gesamtausgabe supported the server set up and automation.  The goal is to provide an easy, long-term hosting option for editions based on minimal, well-documented requirements: ultimately any edition which complies with the recommended practices can benefit from the hosting offer and participate in the portal service.  If you are interested in having an edition hosted, please contact Archives Online. The service will not be for free: any serious long-term hosting has to cover certain maintenance costs if it wants to follow more than an \"install and forget\" policy. But we're confident that our solution minimizes the costs while providing the best possible service, in particular if you're looking towards long-term availability.   Technical Background  e-editiones central goal is to provide editions with a sustainable publishing solution which ensures long term availability with minimal maintenance. With the redesign of TEI Publisher 6 and 7, we prepared the necessary technical foundations: all editions generated by TEI Publisher now share a common API.  With the new version 7 it became possible to:  1. host multiple editions created with different versions of the libraries side by side, 2. simplify the update procedure to make sure editions benefit from new developments while keeping maintenance costs very low, 3. search across local and distributed editions (hosted on a different server) by leveraging the shared API  Also, despite looking different on the surface, the building blocks for any TEI Publisher-based edition are the same, which allows server administrators to create automated setup and maintenance routines.   Outlook  Among many other things, TEI Publisher 8 will further improve the architecture by introducing more generic concepts for persistent URLs, navigation and addressing documents, allowing editions to use an addressing scheme which better reflects the logic of the edition rather than technical requirements.  A direct integration with git will allow editions to update published data without having to touch the command line.  The upcoming version will also include index configuration and API endpoints for local and distributed portal search, so generated editions can automatically participate in a multi-edition portal like sources-online.  With these low-level technical questions solved, e-editiones is now also putting a strong focus on describing the practical recommendations for the encoding of texts. The idea is to create a set of best practice guidelines for corpora with a pledge that any text following these guidelines will look good out of the box when rendered via TEI Publisher and will be ready for incorporation into the search portal. Initial work is carried out now and we expect a community meetup soon to discuss on a broader forum.  This way we aim to: flatten the learning curve for many projects starting with TEI encoding, reduce the amount of customization work required for an edition, allowing users to publish materials with minimal effort, and assure that the project data is ready to be integrated into larger scale search portals. Needless to say, recommendations we have in mind are intended only with an eye towards interoperability and do not limit in any way customization capacities already embodied by the TEI Publisher approach."},{"id":"/pages/member-directory/","title":"Member Directory","content":" \\[profilepress-member-directory id=\"1\"\\] "},{"id":"/posts/contributing-to-tei-publisher-a-gentle-introduction/","title":"Contributing to TEI Publisher - a gentle introduction","content":" Talk by Wolfgang Meier (eXist Solutions) on Tuesday, the 6th of July 2021 at 17:00 CEST.

This paper, just presented at the virtual TEI conference, aims to demonstrate how critically important aspects of an edition can be reconstructed from a rather minimal data set and how such a _survival kit_ can be useful not only for disaster recovery but also as a sustainable approach for the maintenance of scholarly publications.  !Poster for 2021 TEI Conference by Magdalena Turska  The following schemata are the key components of the _survival kit_:  - Source documents - Document encoding and transformation scheme - Layout templates - Interoperable metadata mapping specification  TEI is the perfect archival format for text-centric data: human readable and easy to process - as long as we have the capacity to read text files we can recover the information from a repository of TEI texts. TEI encoded documents with an associated ODD schema and documentation already form a solid basis for reconstruction even if the ODD would say nothing about the final form of the publication as intended by the editors.  !TEI source and rendition via the Processing Model  The TEI Processing Model covers part of this territory, describing how a source document should be transformed for publication. Nevertheless, in the virtual realm, the document is always accompanied by a certain context on the page: controls to zoom in or out, facing facsimile image or switch between normalized and original spellings, just to name a few options. To explicitly define such a context and specify how a publication page would look and behave we can rely on HTML5 layout templates. A modern, web components based approach to website design gives us a beautifully simple and expressive method of assembling web pages from a virtual Lego block equivalent.  !HTML5 page layout using web components  The last missing piece is to document how abstract concepts, e.g. author or date of creation are realized in the encoding so we can recover and use them for queries within the publication as well as for data interchange with other systems. Given the richness of TEI it’s impossible to prescribe what metadata needs to be gathered and how exactly it should be encoded in any given project. On the other hand, it is rather simple to express the mapping in XML, e.g. with an index configuration syntax.  !Sample index configuration with fields and facets  Such a set of specifications preserves all the information necessary to rebuild the edition from scratch, focusing on the intentions and decisions of the editor while filtering out the ephemeral or secondary presentation aspects. Good to put in the vault and send into space but equally useful when the time to migrate to a new infrastructure comes.  !Original Dodis layout  How does it work in practice? You might want to have a closer look at one of the TEI Publisher's demo apps _When the Wall came Down_ which we managed to recreate on the basis of TEI sources and accompanying ODD released by Dodis on the 30th anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. We managed to get a draft version in only 165 lines of custom code and during just one day of pre-conference workshop. Our task would be still simpler if we also had the web page template and index configuration available.  !Recreated document view  Given that there's barely an extra effort involved in assembling the survival kit, preparing it is a clear win. After all, we already have the sources and the ODD! Enriching it with a processing model is not particularly difficult, especially if we use it to generate our transformations. Similarly, in most database systems we will need to prepare the index configurations. At this point we probably don't need to mention that TEI Publisher already implements this approach since quite a few versions (ODD with the processing model from inception, web components for user interface since version 4 and fields and facets since version 5).  Just think about it, if you pack your edition nicely, it becomes a present which archives and libraries would very much like to keep safe in their vaults and running on their servers forever..."},{"id":"/posts/tei-conference-2021-talk-flexible-browser-based-annotations-for-tei/","title":"TEI Conference 2021 Talk: \"Flexible, Browser-Based Annotations for TEI\"","content":" Wolfgang Meier and Joe Wicentowski explain the web-based annotation feature introduced with TEI Publisher 7.1.

Finished examples will include the source TEI under a license allowing redistribution, an ODD for display, and, where necessary, an HTML template. We in particular look for examples covering one or more of the following areas:  - The sample TEI material is from a domain or focuses on research topics not yet covered by TEI Publisher examples. - It demonstrates one or more particular features of the TEI Processing Model and TEI Publisher in a way other users can learn from. For example, ODD processing model rules, a special use of components in an HTML template, or well-designed, high quality print output. - It covers languages or scripts not currently represented in TEI Publisher, especially RTL or CJK languages. We would appreciate if this could be accompanied by a translation into one of the European languages to make the example easier to interpret for users unfamiliar with a particular script.  The first 5 proposals accepted will receive 500 Swiss Francs each upon delivery of the complete sample.

Today there are 12 institutional and 30 individual members. However, it remains our goal to attract new members who will continuously support the association.  One of e-editiones' strategic goals is to ensure the long-term availability of digital editions. To this end e-editiones supports hosting offers that also include the continuous maintenance of digital editions (software updates). This year Archives Online has set up such an offer with «Sources Online». Some of the editions associated with e-editiones already use the Sources Online servers.  In February 2021, e-editiones received a grant by the Ernst Göhner Stiftung. The joint proposal was backed by a number of members and their institutions. Together with the additional generous contributions made by participating projects, this grant supported a larger part of the development work past year.  With the Escher correspondence, a prominent Swiss edition has been migrated to TEI Publisher. This step has been necessary since maintenance and hosting with the previous setup became too expensive in the long term. With TEI Publisher application hosted by Sources Online, the annual costs are reduced to a third.

TEI Publisher Developments  In February 2021 e-editiones successfully applied for a grant by the Ernst Göhner Stiftung, from which we received 30000 SFR for further TEI Publisher development. The joint proposal was backed by a number of members and their institutions and included features like:  - support for web annotations - versioning and long term availability - persistent URLs - accessibility - showing and navigating events in a timeline - display of mathematical formulas  Obviously the budget did not suffice to cover everything planned, but thanks to the additional contributions provided by the member institutions, we could address the main topics and even go beyond in some areas.   Web Annotations  The most visible feature is the editor for web-based annotations, released in version 7.1.0. The development team had been contemplating this feature already for a couple years and thanks to additional generous funding by the Office of the Historian at the US Department of State, it finally became reality. Being able to annotate TEI documents via a graphic, web based interface eases the burden of enhancing a transcription with semantic, analytic or text-critical markup. Users work in a user-friendly environment in which XML code is neatly hidden from sight. The integration of external authority databases saves a lot of time, improves consistency and opens possibilities for data exchange and interoperability. At the same time, the annotation editor is fully configurable, allowing complex, nested markup where necessary. Several member institutions are actively using the editor in their daily work and continue to contribute to its development.  The annotation editor marks the first milestone in our endeavour to extend TEI Publisher to support the entire editing workflow rather than just publishing the end result. Further steps are already in planning, e.g. form-based editing of the TEI header, which will offer the same level of customizability and extensibility.   Web Components  Several new web components have been released during the past year: most notable, a new timeline component allows users to visualise dates and events in an interactive, graphical display. The component can be used to directly select a date or date range, or it can be connected to a facetted search to drill down into a collection of items. Development was supported by the Staatsarchiv Zürich. This component is prominently featured in the remake of the Alfred Escher correspondence edition (to be announced soon).  The Bernoulli edition in Basel financed a component to display mathematical formulas embedded in the TEI text, using either MathML or TeX notation. Other new components include a grid element for viewing tabular data, and a \"split list\", which comes handy when browsing lists of places, people or abbreviations. The latter was again financed by the Staatsarchiv Zürich and first appeared in the Escher correspondence.  As usual, many other components have seen major improvements needed by concrete projects. For example, the map component is now able to display a large number of places at once by clustering the markers.   TEI Publisher 8  The next major release of TEI Publisher is currently being finalized. It will include a few breaking changes, mainly in the libraries used, but as usual we're aiming to remain as backwards compatible as possible. One reason for the breaking changes is to better support persistent, bookmarkable URLs as well as browsing the navigation history. The goal is to make the URL structure as seen by the end-user completely independent of the underlying organization of documents and collections. This involves both a server- and client-side part.  The main remaining task on the way to the release is to extensively document the possibilities and approaches enabled by those changes.   Other Software Packages  In line with our modular development policy, a number of software packages which should be considered part of Publisher 8 are published in separate repositories:  - tuttle - a Git Integration for eXist-db (stable): allows synchronizing a data collection directly from a github or gitlab repository to the database. It can deal with multiple repositories as well as incremental updates. Thanks to the Karl Barth Gesamtausgabe for contributing funding. - TEI Publisher Named Entity Recognition API (beta): adds named entity recognition to the web-based annotation editor. Use it to identify places, people and other entities while annotating a document. The package also provides scripts to train your own model based on already annotated documents via machine learning. Training data is automatically extracted from the annotated document by TEI Publisher, so there's no need to go through the tedious task of compiling suitable data by hand. - Static Site Generator for TEI Publisher (beta): transform a website based on TEI Publisher into a static version, which no longer requires TEI Publisher nor eXist-db. The feature intends to provide a low cost option for small editions whose main purpose is to allow users to browse through a collection of texts without demanding sophisticated search or navigation facilities. Generated files can be easily hosted on free services like GitHub pages. To see it in action, visit our viewer for the TEI Guidelines, which we used as a testbed. - Docker Compose Configuration (beta): a configuration to help users install a TEI Publisher-based application on a docker-enabled host. It handles the more difficult tasks of installing a reverse proxy in front of Publisher as well as registering an SSL certificate. Hosting via docker compose can be a viable option for smaller projects with limited budget and users who lack the server administration skills necessary to set up a dedicated hosting service. - Fore: an XForms-inspired library for building complex forms with web components. While this is not an integral part of TEI Publisher yet, it will become the fundament for many of the future, workflow-related features we have in mind (see below).   The Future  The e-editiones board will prepare a new joint funding proposal soon. To be successfull we'll again need projects or institutions to express interest and signal readiness to make a contribution (in whatever way). If you are working with TEI Publisher and wish for a certain feature, please do not hesitate to contact us, so we can add it to the list of topics.  A main area we currently have in mind is to further enhance TEI Publisher with respect to supporting the editorial workflow:  - integrate general metadata - i.e. TEI header - editing facilities based on customizable forms - add an interface to manage local authorities within the annotation framework - support other annotation types, e.g. empty elements and stand-off annotations which are not inlined - named entitiy recognition: automatically connect detected entities with matching authority entries - allow batch processing of entire documents via named entity recognition - support multi-user workflows with support for a annotate/review/merge process  Other areas might be:  - a form-based interface to customize basic settings and CSS variables - direct integration with Transkribus and other HTR/OCR software - support for other input formats (Excel, CSV) - remove the dependency on Google Material Design to make all visual aspects configurable - port the core TEI processing model implementation to be usable without eXist (e.g. directly within oXygen) - drop the somewhat arbitrary distinction between browsing and searching currently imposed by publisher and refactor the search API to be more easily customizable - enhance and speed up search result display (KWIC)  If any of this rings a bell, please consider if you could support it by taking part in the joint funding proposal. Obviously we'll also be more than happy to pick up suggestions not yet on the list. "},{"id":"/posts/names-sell-named-entity-recognition-in-tei-publisher/","title":"Names sell: Named entity recognition in TEI Publisher","content":" TEI Publisher 8 will include experimental support for detecting and tagging named entities in texts. The idea is to further simplify the work of editors when annotating documents via TEI Publisher’s web-based annotation editor by automatically identifying potential candidates for people, places etc.  !  If you have the development branch (or future TEI Publisher 8) installed and the named entity recognition (NER) service running (more on this below), an additional button will be shown in the top left toolbar. Clicking on it gives you a choice of NER models to use. By default those are the standard models provided by the NER engine we're using. Below we see NER in action, detecting entities in a modern-language text copied from wikipedia.   !NER in action  Entities identified by NER get a marker in striped color, which allows users to distinguish them from annotations, which were manually tagged. The user can now review the identified entities, assign them an authority entry etc. As each annotation is reviewed, the stripes will be removed.  While NER works well in this case on a modern language text, you'll soon encounter the limits of the standard model when trying it out on different types of literature. However, we can gradually improve the quality of the entity recognition by feeding completely annotated documents back into the process, i.e. train our own recognition model. The ideal workflow could be imagined as follows:  - editors manually tag a portion of documents via web-based annotations - once a certain number of entities has been tagged, we can train a custom model - continuing the annotation process, the custom model can be used to identify potential candidates for semantic annotations, thus improving the workflow - the model is retrained on the growing set of fully annotated documents, resulting in better prediction rates  The ultimate goal is to make this process as smooth as possible, i.e. it should not hinder your editing work, but support it!  The integration in TEI Publisher is completely functional, but we need more testing, experimenting and kicking the tires with some real-world use cases. NLP is not a simple subject and I’m in no way an expert, so I’d like to invite the community to help. I have just prepared the ground work.   Technical Background  There are plenty of NLP and NER libraries and tools. However, such libraries work on plain text, not structured texts like TEI. They will get confused by angle brackets (just like many humans). The trick thus is to transform the XML into a plain text without loosing context, which means we somehow need to keep track of element boundaries, offsets of inline elements etc.  Likewise, the result of running NER is again a plain text document, accompanied by a list of detected entities and character offsets. Those need to be mapped back onto the XML structure and eventually merged into the TEI. This back-and-forth conversion is the main job handled by TEI Publisher and its API.  My first idea was to integrate another, existing command-line tool for enriching TEI with named entities. But after a few first experiments, it occurred to me that TEI Publisher already had some important bits and pieces in place within the annotation framework:  - it defines a standoff JSON format to keep annotations separate from the TEI as long as the user is making changes. The web-based editor reads this format to display the nice fruit salad - i.e. marked entities - you see on screen. - it implements algorithms to merge the standoff annotations into inline TEI elements. This works loss-less: anything which is not an annotation is left untouched. The merge algorithm is fast and reliable.  We could thus reuse those building blocks and just add a communication layer, which mediates between TEI Publisher and the external NLP library. This communication layer has been realized through a set of Open API endpoints on both sides, allowing them to have a conversation, sending data back and forth. Below you see the NLP API endpoints exposed by TEI Publisher:  !  The NLP part is a python service using spaCy as the underlying NLP library. Compared to many NLP libraries I have seen before, spaCy has a rather simple, clean API. Getting started proved to be smooth and painless as most of the functionality comes pre-configured and ready to be used. A Python notebook demonstrating how to do a simple NER with spaCy is shown below:  !  SpaCy can do more than just NER, e.g. part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, sentence segmentation, text classification, lemmatization, morphological analysis. It is also quite extensible, allowing other libraries to be plugged into its pipelines.   Training a model  Whenever you use a general-purpose NER model, you’ll quickly notice that it works great for some types of texts, i.e. texts similar to the ones it was trained on. However, results quickly degrade if you apply it to other genres or texts written in a slightly different period of time. For example, the German standard model in spaCy produces good results when run on a text from Wikipedia, but it already starts missing things when you apply it to letters written in the first half of the 20th century: the language used back then was just different, some would say: more sophisticated, than the language used today.  For example, if we run the standard German model against a letter by theologian Karl Barth written in 1921, many words are wrongly identified as places:  !  For most real world scenarios, there’s thus no way around training your own custom model. Fortunately this fits rather well into the annotation workflow implemented by TEI Publisher: usually, training a model involves going through a large amount of text to tell the NLP engine which words are considered part of an entity and which are not. Sometimes this is done in tabular form - which is quite tedious, but there are also tools to support the task, e.g. Prodigy, a commercial application created by the makers of spaCy.  All those approaches have one disadvantage: you do all the hard work just for the purpose of training a model. Compared to this, enriching the TEI with entities is a useful task in itself. Even if you figure out later that you can’t really use NER, the work invested is not lost. TEI Publisher tries to make this as seamless as possible, being able to transform any semantically rich TEI into training data. Preparing training data is thus kind of a natural side effect of annotating documents and does not require additional manual steps or separate tagging.  TEI Publisher exposes an API endpoint through which you can download training data in JSON format for either a single document or a whole collection.  It chunks the text into blocks (paragraphs, headings etc.) and extracts a plain text representation of each. Here it is important that sentences are preserved semantically. Inline notes, apps or choices would appear out of context in the middle of a sentence, so they have to be removed. Notes will be moved into separate blocks at the end.  All existing entities in a block, i.e. persName, placeName etc., are listed along with the text, recording their type, start and end positions:    This will contact a TEI Publisher generated app called `hsg-annotate`and retrieve training data from the `frus1981-88v05` collection below the app's data root, using English as the training language. The output of the command will pretty much look the same as the output you saw on the web before.   Conclusion  Even in its current, rudimentary form, the NER integration in TEI Publisher can already help to speed up the editing workflow. We do need to gain more experience with training custom models though and the community is warmly invited to help with this.  There’s also a lot of room for improving the annotation workflow, e.g. with  - automatically linking detected entities to authority entries (where non-ambiguous) - implement a wizard-like dialog, which walks users through the entities identified by NER one by one, allowing them to quickly confirm or reject an annotation and associate it with the correct authority entry - employ rule-based detection models in addition to the statistical, trained models: for example, if you already have a list of names from a back of book index, a rule-based algorithm may produce better results than a trained model - support batch operation across multiple documents - integrate other spaCy features like part-of-speech tagging etc. "},{"id":"/posts/past-meetings/","title":"Past Community Meetings","content":"  Past Meetings  !Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@esteejanssens?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Estée Janssens</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/calendar?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"unsplash\">Unsplash</a>   2022   2022-07-18 Register of Older Slovenian Manuscripts  Matija Ogrin (Institute of Slovenian Literature and Literary Studies ZRC SAZU Ljubljana) and Magdalena Tuska (JinnTec GmbH)   2022-07-05 TraveLab: a multilingual mapped edition of Benjamin of Tudela's travelog.

Open source projects like TEI Publisher depend on an active, contributing community. Many believe that you need to be a programmer to contribute, but this is a misconception! Documentation, communication, supporting users or providing feedback are at least as important for an open source project as thousands of lines of code.  This session targets non-programmers as well as those with some development skills. We'll start with simple things, e.g. contributing to the FAQ, and then move on and show you how to create your own little web component to plug into TEI Publisher. We'll use a grid component for displaying tabular data as an example.   2021-06-15: For(e) humanists - Metadata, Forms and more  Joern Turner, eXistSolutions and Jinntec GmbH  Fore is a model-driven forms framework that follows the ideas of the XForms 2.0 Standard but translates those into the world of HTML5 Web Components.  Many edition project require some sort of complex input form sooner or later - just think about collecting metadata for the TEI header.
