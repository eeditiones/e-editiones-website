<p>We are offering a workshop entitled «Have yourself a TEI-Christmas» to be offered online via Zoom. The workshop will take place on three consecutive Wednesdays (Nov, 30; Dec 7 and 14) from 11:00-15:00 Eastern Standard Time/17:00-21:00 Central European Time.</p>
<p>This introductory workshop offers the basic concepts and methods of creating a digital edition from start to finish and will offer an overview of XML/TEI standards and FAIR principles using the Oxygen XML Editor. The workshop will be taught using a hands-on-approach: we will provide materials for practice, but there will also be time for participants to work on their own projects with guidance from the workshop organizers. Using provided examples as well as their own texts, participants will learn the basics of project organization, XML scripting, and practical skills like integrating digital images into digital text editions. The primary audience of this workshop is those who are newcomers to the Digital Humanities and who would like to learn the essentials -as well as the possibilities and potential pitfalls - of bringing analog texts into a digital environment. No previous experience with coding or XML is assumed.</p>
