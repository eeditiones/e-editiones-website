Wolfgang Meier and Joe Wicentowski explain the web-based annotation feature introduced with TEI Publisher 7.1. We briefly introduce TEI Publisher 7.1's [Annotation Facility](https://tei-publisher.org/exist/apps/tei-publisher/doc/documentation.xml?id=web-annotations) and the workflows it supports. Joe Wicentowski then demonstrates how the [Office of the Historian](https://history.state.gov/) uses the tool to annotate documents from the Foreign Relations series.
