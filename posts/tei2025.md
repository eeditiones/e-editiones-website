From September 16 to 20 e-editiones members will meet at this year's TEI Annual Conference and Members’ Meeting [**TEI2025 - New Territories**](https://tei2025.confer.uj.edu.pl/) in [Kraków, Poland 🇵🇱](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2768922) at the [Jagiellonian University](https://www.uj.edu.pl/). 

To easily find e-editiones / TEI Publisher related content at the conference we compiled this [list of e-editiones / TEI Publisher related activieties](/tei2025) and created a public #TEI2025 channel in the [e-editiones Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/e-editiones/shared_invite/zt-e19jc03q-OFaVni~_lh6emSHen6pswg). 


We wish all participants a wonderful TEI2025!
