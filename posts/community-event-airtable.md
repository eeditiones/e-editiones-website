Upcoming community meetup on [July 11, 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+Community+Event&iso=20230711T17&p1=1425&ah=1)

Virginia Kinniburgh (US Department of State's [Office of the Historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Historian) will discuss her work building born-digital indexes for volumes in the [Foreign Relations of the United States series](https://history.state.gov), the definitive record of United States foreign policy. The goal was to develop an experimental alternative to the traditional back-of-book indexing process by using [TEI Publisher's annotation tool](https://tei-publisher.com/exist/apps/tei-publisher/annotate/test.xml) to select indexable entities in documents according to categories such as places, people, events, topics, and agreements/mandates. In this project, [TEI Publisher](https://tei-publisher.com/) draws on a collaborative, relational database system called [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), which gathers potential entries across multiple FRUS volumes and projects, to creating browsable facets through which users can better understand the documents. The same annotations can also be used to create index entries and automatically generate an index for the volume.
