Upcoming community meetup on [March 04, 2025 at 17:00 CET](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+community+meetup&iso=20250304T17&p1=1425&ah=1).

Hans Christian Andersen died 150 years ago, but his legacy is thriving. The research center in Andersen´s native town Odense aids readers and researchers alike who want to explore this rich oeuvre. To this aim, we have over the course of just four years launched three digital editions. All three have been produced with TEI Publisher.

In the talk at the community meetup, I first outline the process that helped us at the centre to reach to the current state.

Secondly, I then single out three building blocks that are either new additions to TEI Publisher or could become such:

* Fast search through tables, e.g., on the main landing page (via zing-grid adapted by Magdalena Turska).
* Draggable panels with display of, e.g., facsimiles (jsPanel adapted by Jörn Turner).
* Synoptic visualizations of two, three or more textual variants (via CollateX customized by Karsten Kynde).

As the names in the parentheses indicate, the modules have been crafted by experts within our community. The talk should thereby demonstrate how TEI Publisher delivers one of its main promises: Empowering academics (like myself) to model and build digital scholarly editions without having to become programmers.

In the final dialogue we might discuss whether the two latter building blocks could be bundled with related elements to form a distinct genetic profile in future versions of TEI Publisher? This might aid the creation of coming genetic digital scholarly editions.
