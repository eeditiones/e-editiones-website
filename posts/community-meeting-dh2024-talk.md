Upcoming community meetup on September 03, 2024 at 17:00 CEST

Â«From a publishing tool to a virtual research environment: producing scholarly editions with TEI PublisherÂ» was the name of the presentation ðŸŽ¤ by Joe Wicentowski, Magdalena Turska, Helena Bermudez-Sabel at [DH2024 Reinvention & Responsibility](https://dh2024.adho.org/) in Washington D.C. TEI Publisher provides the means for data storage, modelling, curation, analysis and visualisation while enabling collaborative work. The recent additions to it include form-based editing for metadata and curation of authority files as well as NER support, including training the model and a visual editor for adding semantic markup. The presentation demonstrates how TEI Publisher is utilised over the whole digital edition lifecycle.

Due to [technical glitches](https://social.e-editiones.org/@eeditiones/112921400019070395) the talk was not recorded at DH2024 which is why e-editiones has decided to repeat and record the talk as part of our Community Meetups.
