Community meetup on [October 07, 2025 at 17:00 CEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+community+event&iso=20251007T17&p1=268&ah=1).

A team led by Prof Gadi Sagiv at the open university of Israel is building an annotated collection of [Hasidic stories](https://www.hasidic-stories.org/) published between 1814 to 1914. The stories have been OCR-ed and annotated (in the TEI-Publisher v7 annotator) for people, places and themes, resulting in an extensive TEI-XML corpus which is still expanding. To enable both close and distant reading of the corpus, a browser was built using standard programming frameworks and techniques (.Net Blazor, served from Azure) enabling a flexible and specialized UI and Ux, with complex and multilevel faceting. The browser incorporates TEI-Publisher HTML5 components to display the editions (facsimile and text) as well as the individual stories with additional information. Custom endpoints built with the TEI-Publisher infrastructure use XQuery to extract the relevant information from the corpus as a whole and from individual documents. It is hoped that this approach will enable additional non-standard displays of TEI-Publisher corpora when appropriate.
