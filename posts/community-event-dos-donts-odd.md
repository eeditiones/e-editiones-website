Upcoming community meetup on [July 2, 2024 17:00 CEST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+Community+Event&iso=20240702T17&p1=37&ah=1)

Data modelling is the keystone of DIgital Scholarly editing, thus the importance of well-thought-out schemas in XML-based editions. In this sense, the TEI Guidelines and related resources play a crucial role in aiding scholars throughout the formalisation of a schema, together with the well-known benefits of having datasets that are compliant with this technical standard.

However, many projects use a TEI customisation that wasn’t conceived for being implemented in real Humanities projects, TEI All, arguably a hindrance towards interoperability.

In this community meet-up we will talk about ODD, a specification format that enables the customisation of TEI P5 in a literate programming fashion. We will do an overview of existing resources that assist scholars in the creation of schemas adapted to their project requirements.
