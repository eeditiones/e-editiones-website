Today the new TEI Publisher 6.0.0 is finally out. This is a major release introducing the refactored and extended component library as well as numerous bugfixes and new features.

All Publisher's web components are now available as a LitElement library distributed via npm. While invisible to users, this redesign greatly improves modularity and simplifies updates of Publisher-based applications. It also facilitates embedding of Publisher custom components into CMS systems (e.g. Hugo or WordPress) and other application frameworks (like angular, vue or react).

This version also brings extended internationalization and full localization into 19 languages, simplified styling, support for data organization based on subcollections, several new and enhanced components (including one for [notated music](https://unpkg.com/@teipublisher/pb-components@1.0.0/dist/api.html#pb-mei.1) encoded in MEI), improved ODD editor and major extension and revision of the documentation.
