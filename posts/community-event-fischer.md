Upcoming community meetup on [June 13, 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+Community+Event&iso=20230404T17&p1=1425&ah=1)

For Fischer's 250th birthday in 2023, the Iron Library is realising a digital edition of his travel journals and is also translating the texts from the original German into English for the first time. This will make them accessible to an international readership. The edition is based on the text of Fischer's first editions. The texts are provided with itineraries and detailed index data on people, places, events and terms and enriched with numerous images.
