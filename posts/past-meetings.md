#### 2022

##### 2022-07-18 Register of Older Slovenian Manuscripts

Matija Ogrin (Institute of Slovenian Literature and Literary Studies ZRC SAZU Ljubljana) and Magdalena Tuska (JinnTec GmbH)

##### 2022-07-05 [TraveLab](https://teipublisher.info/exist/apps/TraveLab/index.html): a multilingual mapped edition of Benjamin of Tudela's travelog.

Dr. Sinai Rusinaek, Elijah Lab (Haifa University) and OMILab (Open University), and Gil Shalit, independent developer, [DH-Dev.com](http://dh-dev.com/)

We will show different stages in the preparation of a multi-lingual travelog edition, from modelling, digitization, geo-referencing and alignment, through to the adaptation of TEI-Publisher to provide a meaningful interaction with the texts. We will look specifically at aligning three versions with each other and at extending the pb-leaflet-map’s functionality with Javascript hooks.

We will also briefly demonstrate [XMLPlanter](https://xmlplanter.dh-dev.com/), an open online tool we have developed to assist in preparing parallel editions.

##### 2022-06-07 Names sell: Named entity recognition in TEI Publisher

In this talk we'll learn how to enable the named entity recognition feature in the forthcoming TEI Publisher 8 to assist with semantic annotations. We'll also see how to train a custom recognition model from a set of already annotated documents, discuss the current (early) state of the feature and possible future developments ([transcript of the talk).](https://e-editiones.org/names-sell-named-entity-recognition-in-tei-publisher/)

##### 2022-05-03 Cancelled

##### 2022-04-12 Anatomy of the Alfred Escher Edition: Remastering a sophisticated project to TEI Publisher

The Alfred Escher correspondence represents a prominent edition, which has recently been ported to TEI Publisher to save it from shutting down. The goal was to preserve the existing functionality and site organization while reducing the long-term maintenance costs.

In this talk we'll have a close look at how this task was undertaken and hope to provide some hints for others who may find themselves confronted with similar challenges. On the way we'll also meet some of the new features coming to Publisher 8.

##### 2022-03-01 Orchestrating TEI Publisher and Fore to edit and publish LGPN-Ling

Magdalena Turska

_LGPN-Ling: _Etymological and Semantic analysis of ancient Greek personal names__ is a dictionary accompanying the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names. The purpose of _LGPN-Ling_ is to elucidate the meaning of Greek names, a task which has never before been systematically undertaken and to provide an essential semantical complement to the LGPN Database.

Technical scaffolding of the LGPN-Ling project comprises of:

- eXist database of TEI encoded documents,
- TEI Publisher-based application with an extended API to publish and query the  data,
- Fore XForms to edit the data.

##### 2022-02-01 Tutorial: Connecting components to custom API endpoints

Wolfgang Meier

This will be a tutorial session demonstrating  a new component for displaying categorized lists, e.g. to browse through people or places and paginate the results by first letter of alphabet, country or other categories. We'll learn how to connect this component to the API by creating a custom endpoint.

We'll also look at an enhanced version of the map component to display all places mentioned in an edition in a clustered view.

#### 2021

##### 2021-12-07 Combined Workflow for Publishing Jurisprudentia Frisica

Eduard Drenth, Fryske Akademy

Designing a robust workflow for editors working both in word and in teipublisher.

##### 2021-10-05 An introduction to the Distributed Text Services (DTS)

Pietro Liuzzo, Universität Hamburg

The Distributed Text Services (DTS) Specification defines an API for working with collections of text as machine-actionable data.

[Slides of the talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eFV9Pg9pVHdT6AEUQ9QKi2MZs4X3F53EL-AqJnoviMA/edit?usp=sharing).

##### 2021-09-07: TEI Publisher 7.1 - Configuring Web Annotations

In this session we'll have a closer look at the new web annotations editor in TEI Publisher 7.1. We'll learn how to create a custom annotation app and configure it to match the requirements of a specific edition, i.e. add new annotation types and modify the existing ones.

##### 2021-07-06: Contributing to TEI Publisher - A Gentle Introduction

Talk by Wolfgang Meier (eXist Solutions) on Tuesday, the 6th of July 2021 at 17:00 CEST.

Open source projects like TEI Publisher depend on an active, contributing community. Many believe that you need to be a programmer to contribute, but this is a misconception! Documentation, communication, supporting users or providing feedback are at least as important for an open source project as thousands of lines of code.

This session targets non-programmers as well as those with some development skills. We'll start with simple things, e.g. contributing to the [FAQ](https://faq.teipublisher.com "FAQ"), and then move on and show you how to create your own little web component to plug into TEI Publisher. We'll use a grid component for displaying tabular data as an example.

##### 2021-06-15: For(e) humanists - Metadata, Forms and more

Joern Turner, eXistSolutions and Jinntec GmbH

Fore is a model-driven forms framework that follows the ideas of the XForms 2.0 Standard but translates those into the world of HTML5 Web Components.

Many edition project require some sort of complex input form sooner or later - just think about collecting metadata for the TEI header. The talk will focus on TEI and show you how to author such forms in HTML5.

##### 2021-06-01: FairCopy

Nick Laiacona, President Performant Software Solutions [https://www.performantsoftware.com](https://www.performantsoftware.com)

FairCopy is a specialized word processor for studying manuscripts and historical texts. It gives scholars a desktop editing environment to create TEI encoded texts without writing XML code. In this demonstration, we will explore what sorts of editions you can build using FairCopy and how it can fit into a larger ecosystem of tools leveraging TEI XML.

In addition, Wolfgang will give us a sneak preview of some exciting TEI Publisher 8 features under development.

##### 2021-05-04: Open access scholarly digital editions at the Finnish Literature Society: experiences with TEI Publisher

Maria Niku, Tiedekustantamo, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura – Finnish Literature Society

The Finnish Literature Society ([https://www.finlit.fi/en](https://www.finlit.fi/en)) publishes open access scholarly digital editions of archival material as well as digital critical editions of printed works. We began using eXist-db and TEI Publisher in 2020 for all of our XML-based publications, with two editions published so far and at least three more to be published this year.

Published edition links: [https://kivi.finlit.fi/lea](https://kivi.finlit.fi/lea) [https://gottlund.finlit.fi](https://gottlund.finlit.fi)

The former is in Finnish only, the latter in Finnish and Swedish, but we'll be adding English to the latter in April
