From August 6 till 9, 2024 several e-editiones members are joining the annual conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations: [DH2024 - Reinvention & Responsibility](https://dh2024.adho.org/) at Washington, D.C., ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

To easily find e-editiones / TEI Publisher related content at the conference we compiled this [list of e-editiones / TEI Publisher related activieties](https://e-editiones.org/dh2024) and created a public #DH2024 channel in the [e-editiones SlackÂ workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/e-editiones/shared_invite/zt-e19jc03q-OFaVni~_lh6emSHen6pswg). 

We wish all participants a wonderful DH2024!
