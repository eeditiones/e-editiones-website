Upcoming community meetup on [Feb. 7, 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=e-editiones+Community+Event&iso=20230207T17&p1=1425&ah=1):

The ability of web browsers to generate a usable printout of a digital edition is still limited. Fortunately there are tools to fill the gap. CSS Page Media provides surprising possibilities for those who need a quick solution without learning LaTeX or XSL/FO. In this community meetup we'll explore some of them and see how new additions to TEI Publisher can help with the task.
