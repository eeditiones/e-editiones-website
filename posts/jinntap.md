JinnTap is a new WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You **Mean**) editor for TEI and other XML formats. While usable as a standalone webcomponent, it unveils its full power
when embedded in a broader application context such as TEI Publisher 10.

The following talk was presented at the TEI members meeting and conference in Krak√≥w on September 18, 2025. It provides a first overview of JinnTap, its possibilities and integration into the TP 10 toolbox.
