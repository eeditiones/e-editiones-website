##### üé§ From a publishing tool to a virtual research environment: producing scholarly editions with TEl Publisher 
*Joseph C Wicentowski, Magdalena Turska, Helena Bermudez Sabel, Wolfgang Meier*

> TEI Publisher provides the means for data storage, modelling, curation, analysis and visualisation while enabling collaborative work. The recent additions to it include form-based editing for metadata and curation of authority files as well as NER support, including training the model and visual editor for adding semantic markup.

Currently we can offer only the [presentation](https://prezi.com/view/oNGhA5fu4Nvpp3uiKC5o/). Due to a [technical glitch](https://social.e-editiones.org/@eeditiones/112921400019070395) there is no recording of this talk. We will have the talk again in one of our upcoming online e-editiones [community meetings](/pages/community-meetings/).

| Jagiellonian Digital Platform brings together scholars and IT developers in order to create a supportive environment for interoperable, accessible and sustainable digital scholarly editions. We want to assist scholarly editors in creating new paths into textual analysis and representation, which they might not envision alone. | <div class="download-flyer"> <a href='/assets/files/DH2024-Jagiellonian-Digital-Platform.pdf'> <img src='../img/DH2024-Jagiellonian-Digital-Platform.jpg' width='100%'> <div>Download</div> </a></div>  |

##### üèûÔ∏è Poster Session II -  Reinvention, Responsibility & Resurrection: how to future-proof an edition
*Magdalena Turska, Helena Bermudez Sabel*
| | |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| As software developers and technical editors we find ourselves frequently called in to resurrect a project in danger of extinction. We will discuss experiences and solutions for such a reconstruction/reinvention process which led to creation of a future-proof open publication model based on standards, already implemented in many projects, including Swiss national infrastructure Sources Online. | <div class="download-flyer"> <a href='/assets/files/DH2024-future-proof-an-edition.pdf'> <img src='../img/DH2024-future-proof-an-edition.jpg' width='100%'> <div>Download</div> </a></div>  |
